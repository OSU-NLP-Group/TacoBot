This will prevent your milk from burning, and you should only have to stir it occasionally. If you cannot do this, and must heat the milk directly, be sure to monitor it constantly, stirring all of the while. If you do not have a thermometer, 185\\u00baF (85\\u00baC) is the temperature at which milk starts to froth. It is highly recommended that you obtain a thermometer in the range of 100 - 212\\u00baF, especially if you plan to make yogurt on an ongoing basis.\\nYou can use any kind of milk, including whole milk, 2 percent, 1 percent, nonfat, pasteurized, homogenized, organic, raw, diluted evaporated, dry powdered, cow, goat, soybean, and more. UHP, or ultra-high pasteurized milk, is processed to a higher temperature, which breaks down some of the proteins that the bacteria need to make the milk into yogurt. Some have reported difficulties in making yogurt from UHP.\", \"The best way to do this is with a cold water bath. This will quickly and evenly lower the temperature, and requires only occasional stirring. If cooling at room temperature, or in the refrigerator, you must stir it more frequently. Don't proceed until the milk is below 120\\u00baF (49\\u00baC), and don't allow it to go below 90\\u00baF (32\\u00baC); 110\\u00baF (43\\u00baC) is optimal.\", \"The starter is the bacteria that you add to the milk, which in turn cultivates more bacteria--bacteria that is necessary for the creation of yogurt. Let the starter yogurt sit at room temperature while you're waiting for the milk to cool. This will prevent it from being too cold when you add it in.\\n\\nAll yogurt needs \\\"good\\\" bacteria. The easiest way to add this is to use existing yogurt. The first time you make your own yogurt, use store-bought plain (unflavored) yogurt. Be certain it has \\\"active cultures\\\" on the label. Yogurt cultures die over time so try and find the freshest yogurt that has a tart flavor, but no added flavors or other additives. Taste various plain yogurts before you get started. You will find that different kinds taste a bit different. Use one you like for your own starter. The different flavors are due to other bacteria than the two main bacteria needed to create yogurt.\\nAlternatively, instead of using existing yogurt, use freeze-dried bacteria cultures (available in specialty stores or online), which are more reliable as a starter.\\nIn a pinch, you can use a flavored yogurt, but the taste of the resulting cultured yogurt will not be exactly the same as using plain yogurt.\", \"Adding about 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup dry milk at this time will increase the nutritional content of the yogurt. The yogurt will also thicken more easily. This is especially helpful if you're using nonfat milk.\", \"Add 2 tablespoons of the existing yogurt, or add the freeze-dried bacteria. Stir with a whisk or use a blender (such as a stick blender) to evenly distribute the bacteria throughout the milk. If you still have stringy ropes you may be heating your milk too fast or too long (scalding). Use a double boiler in that case, or at least stir regularly and check temperature with a thermometer. At high altitudes this can be more of a problem.\"], [\"Pour the milk into a clean container or containers. Cover each one tightly with a lid or plastic wrap.\\nYou could also use Ball jars if you are so inclined, but these are not necessary.\", \"Keep the yogurt warm and still to encourage bacterial growth, while keeping the temperature as close to 100\\u00baF (38\\u00baC) as possible. The longer the mixture incubates, the thicker and more tangy the yogurt will be.\\n\\nKeep the yogurt still during incubation. Jiggling won't ruin it, but it makes it take a lot longer to incubate.\\nAfter seven hours, you'll have a custard-like texture, a cheesy odor, and possibly some greenish liquid on top. This is exactly what you want. The longer you let it sit beyond seven hours, the thicker and tangier it will become.\", \"Use a thermometer to make sure the temperature stays consistent. Choose the method that is most convenient and consistent for you. The most common way is to use a yogurt maker. The proper way to use a yogurt maker is detailed in the following steps.\\n\\nYou could also use the pilot light in your oven, or preheat the oven to the desired temperature, turn it off, and then leave the oven light on to maintain the temperature.Turn your oven on periodically, as needed to maintain the temperature. This method is tricky; make sure that it doesn't get too hot. Or, you could use the bread proof setting if your oven has one.\\nOther methods include using a food dehydrator, a rice cooker's warm setting, a heating pad set to low, or a crock pot set on its lowest setting.\\nIf you have none of these things, you could use a sunny window or a car in the sun. Note that light exposure may degrade the nutrition in the milk. It is best to maintained the temperature  below 120\\u00baF (49\\u00baC), don't allow it to go below 90\\u00baF (32\\u00baC); blood temp to 110\\u00baF (43\\u00baC) is optimal. Additionally, you could place the container of yogurt in warm water in a sink, large bowl, or small picnic cooler.\", \"There are several categories of retail yogurt makers available today, if you decide to use a yogurt maker (which is recommended.) Yogurt makers allow for the safest and timeliest incubation of the yogurt bacteria.\\n\\nThe untimed, resistance heated yogurt makers are generally popular because of their low cost. They tend to be less expensive because they are designed with no control over the temperatures needed to properly incubate the yogurt bacterial culture(s) in the dairy product used.  They are designed for average home temperatures but higher or lower environmental temperatures can change the time it takes to make the yogurt and quality of the yogurt produced. They generally come with smaller cups and must be used repeatedly throughout each week to provide for daily consumption of yogurt. With larger families, they can become impractical because of the time it takes to make a given quantity of yogurt.\\nThe temperature regulating yogurt makers are more expensive as they require more electronic components to be able to maintain temperature settings. There are two types within this category:\\nAnother type has an (optimal) factory temperature setting which is maintained regardless of environment. You cannot adjust the temperature setting in this type.\\nThere are yogurt makers which combine some of the features found in some of the above categories. For example, one yogurt maker provides a factory set regulated temperature with a time - display and cut-off feature. This unit is capable of producing a quality yogurt result in as little as 2 hours as the temperature setting is well above popular home yogurt culturing temperatures. It allows the user to use more than cup-sized containers, although they are supplied in several sizes with the yogurt maker. You can use a gallon size container or 4 wide-mouth quart containers to make as much as a gallon at a time. However, with the taller jars, either a larger cover may be needed or towels may be used to cover the gap between the supplied cover and bottom (heating and control) unit.\", \"The user can adjust the temperature setting of the yogurt maker to maintain the proper temperatures associated with the bacterial strain(s) used in the culturing of the yogurt.  Once set, they will maintain the setting, regardless of how warm or cold your home or kitchen may be.\\nYogurt makers which allow the user to set the amount of time the yogurt maker applies heat to the containers.  While this time setting may be handy should you need to leave the yogurt maker unattended, it is suggested the user remain in the general area (home) so that if anything should go wrong (like the unit failing to shut off) - granted a rare occurrence - may deal with the situation.\", \"Make sure they are evenly spaced out and standing up straight (you wouldn't want them to tip over or the yogurt could leak out.)\", \"That maintains the containers at a temperature which, hopefully, allows the bacteria in the tempered dairy product in the containers go grow and thrive to make yogurt.\", \"In due time - depending on bacterial strain(s) used, temperature and food available in the dairy product - the dairy product will firm up to a yogurt consistency.  This can take as little as 2 hours and can last 12 hours or longer. The shorter times usually result in less tart yogurts and longer times provide completion of the bacterial growth.  For those lactose intolerant folks, the longer times may produce a more digestible yogurt.\", \"Once the yogurt has gotten to the consistency and time desired, the containers are removed from the yogurt maker and placed in a refrigerator to cool for storage until consumption. The containers, which may be supplied with the yogurt maker, can be small cups so that the user can eat the yogurt right out of the cups. Containers as large as a gallon or more can be held by some yogurt makers for those who need large amounts of yogurt on a regular basis.\", \"Try gently jiggling one of the containers - the yogurt will not move if it is ready and you can take it from the yogurt maker and put it in the refrigerator then. Or you can wait and let it get more tart for 12 hours or more.\"], [\"Put the cheesecloth in a colander and put the colander in a large bowl to catch the whey, which is a thin yellow liquid. Put the yogurt in the colander, cover the colander with a plate, and put it all in the refrigerator.  Strain for a couple of hours for greek yogurt.  Strain overnight for a very thick yogurt, almost like soft cream cheese.\", \"Place the yogurt in your fridge for several hours before serving. It will keep for 1 to 2 weeks. If you're going to use some of it as starter, use it within 5 to 7 days, so that the bacteria still have growing power. Whey will form on the top. You can pour it off or stir it in before eating your yogurt.\\nMany commercial yogurts include a thickening agent, such as pectin, starch, gum, or gelatin. Don't be surprised or concerned if your homemade yogurt has a somewhat thinner consistency without these thickeners. Putting the yogurt in the freezer to cool it before to moving it to the refrigerator will result in a smoother consistency. You can also stir or shake in the lumps.\", \"Experiment until you develop a flavor that your taste buds fancy. Canned pie filling, jams, maple syrup, and ice-cream fudges are good flavorings.

Naturally-occurring sugars in fruit and milk come with vitamins, minerals, and fiber making them much more nutritious.\\n\\nNaturally-occurring sugars include fructose (found in fruit) and lactose (found in milk).\\nAll fruit, fruit products (like unsweetened applesauce), and dairy products (like yogurt, milk or cottage cheese) contain naturally-occurring sugars.\\nYou can make a variety of healthier swaps by substituting foods that contain natural sugar for added sugar.\", \"Sugar is commonly added to processed and packaged foods to improve the taste, texture, and shelf life.\\n\\nFrozen food, packaged snacks, canned soup, sauces, salad dressings, and marinades often have added sugar. Try making some of these items from scratch if you can.\\nGo for unsweetened and plain varieties whenever possible.  For example, consume unsweetened applesauce or plain yogurt.  Flavored items generally contain added sugars.\\nEven fruit can be loaded with sugar when it's processed. Fruit juice has been stripped of fiber and water that helps you feel full. Go for whole fruit.\"], [\"One of the most common and obvious sources of added sugars are in foods like candy, cookies, cakes, pastries, and other dessert-type foods.

Giving up on these can help cut out a large portion of added sugar in your diet.\\n\\nAs mentioned before, you can choose to cut out these foods cold turkey or taper them slowly out of your diet.\\nYou may find it helpful to plan some naturally sweetened, healthy alternatives into your day.\", \"Sweet treats provide a lot of enjoyment in our diets.  When you're trying to give up sugar, it'll be helpful to find low-sugar or naturally sweetened alternatives when you're in the mood to indulge.\\n\\nUse fruit instead.

Try doing the following to keep your restaurant meals sugar-free:\\n\\nGet your salads dressed with plain oil and vinegar, rather than choosing a pre-made salad dressing.  Also, always ask for dressings to be served on the side.\\nAsk for main dishes to be made without sauces and gravies that might have added sugar.  Again, ask for these to be served on the side.\\nWhen in doubt, order steamed vegetables or plain grilled meats instead of casseroles and other mixed dishes that contain a lot of ingredients.\\nFor dessert, opt for a plain bowl of fruit or skip it altogether.\", \"Since many people are giving up sugars and have become more health conscious, scientists have developed different artificial sweeteners as low-calorie replacements.

Either go cold-turkey on that day, or start scaling back your sugar consumption.\", \"Get into the habit of reading nutrition labels on all the products you buy to check the sugar content. Buy low-sugar foods that have less than 6 g of sugar per serving.\\nRemember to look at the serving size on foods as well. Usually, there are multiple servings in one package, so you\\u2019ll eat a lot more sugar than you intended to if you have the whole package at once.\", \"This range is the official World Health Organization recommendation for added sugars, meaning sugars that manufacturers use during the production process. Women should limit their intake to 25 g and men should limit theirs to 36 g. Plan your meals around these limits so you don\\u2019t eat too much sugar.\\n\\nUse nutrition labels and add up the total sugar content in the ingredients you're using.

Only add 1-2 teaspoons to stay within the daily limit.\\nTea and coffee are usually packed with sugar if you buy them already sweetened.

Replace them with water or seltzer, and add some chopped fruit for flavor if you want.\\n\\nCheck the sugar content on fruit juices as well. These can also be very sugary.\\nAlso be careful with prepared coffee drinks like lattes and frappes. These usually have a lot of added sugar. Order yours with no sugar, or stick with a simple coffee instead.\", \"White bread products are enriched with simple carbohydrates. These products have a high glycemic index, meaning they make your blood sugar spike, so avoid them as much as you can. Replace these products with whole wheat or grain varieties instead.\\nGenerally, white products are enriched. White bread, bagels, muffins, and rice tend to have high glycemic indexes.\", \"Breakfast cereals are a hidden source of sugar in many people\\u2019s diets. Depending on the type, some cereals have over 15 g of added sugars, along with enriched flours. This could add a lot of sugar to your diet, so use caution when you get cereal. Read all the labels and get cereals with low sugar.\\nIf you don\\u2019t like the taste of low-sugar cereal, try adding fruit or cinnamon for more flavor.\", \"Condiments are another sneaky way that you might be adding a lot of sugar to your diet. Ketchup, barbeque sauce, salad dressings, teriyaki sauce, and some tomato sauces are loaded with sugar for flavoring. Check the labels on all the condiments you buy and eliminate ones with high sugar contents.\\n\\nYou can still use some of these condiments, but limit the serving size. Measure out a spoonful to control the amount you have.\\nSome low-sugar condiments are mustard, mayonnaise, sauerkraut, and relish. Still check the nutrition labels, because some brands may add sugar.\"], [\"If you don\\u2019t want to stop using sugar cold-turkey, a good strategy is making an immediate reduction in the amount that you use. If you regularly add sugar to your coffee, food, or baked goods, cut the amount that you use in half. \\n\\nYour craving for sweet foods is part of the addition. Once you break your habit, food and drinks that are less sweet will taste just fine to you.\\nAs you get used to less-sweet foods and drinks, you can reduce your sugar usage even more until you gradually cut it out entirely.\", \"When you swear-off sugar, treat it as an opportunity to explore other flavors.

These are sugar-free, but don\\u2019t have a good effect on weight-loss or other health goals.\", \"Fruit is naturally-sweet and can sweeten your food and drinks without any added sugar. Chop up some of your favorite fruits and add them to your oatmeal, drinks, pancakes, and baked items to get a sweet flavor without sugar.\\n\\nTry infusing your water or seltzers with chopped fruit like lemon, grapes, and raspberries. This adds flavor and nutrition to plain drinks.\\nDried fruits like raisins and cranberries are good ways to sweeten your oatmeal or cereal. Be sure to check and make sure they aren\\u2019t coated in any sugar, though.\", \"By baking your own desserts, you can control the amount of sugar you in them. You could even replace sugar altogether with different ingredients. This is a great way to continue enjoying desserts without overdoing it with sugar.\\n\\nCinnamon and nutmeg are good non-sugar ingredients to bake with.\\nMany people replace sugar with apple sauce in baking recipes. This is a much healthier alternative.\"], [\"If sugary foods are in your home, then you\\u2019ll probably be tempted to eat them.

It also helps keep you full, so you\\u2019ll have fewer hunger cravings as well. Include a source of protein in every meal to keep your body nourished and free from sugar cravings.\\n\\nGood protein sources are chicken and poultry, fish, beans, nuts and seeds, peanut or almond butter, eggs, and dairy products.\\nTry to avoid protein sources with a lot of saturated fats, like red meat.

However, other detox diets suggest eating fruit in place of other sugary foods, while cutting out refined sugars and flours.\\nIt's up to you how far you want to go. If you really want to cut sugar cravings, you can try taking a more severe approach, at least for the initial 10 days. On the other hand, fruit has important nutrients and fiber so you may want to include it while detoxing from sugar. Talk to your doctor about what's best for you and your health.\", \"If at all possible, clear your cupboards of things like sugary snacks, pre-processed foods, and white bread. Look for any foods with sugars, and toss them or donate them to a charity. If they're out of your home, you're less likely to cave and eat them.\\nIf you're living in a household where other people aren't going to detox, try having a separate cabinet for your food so you don't have to be as tempted by sugary choices.\", \"Sometimes, you may mistake thirstiness for hunger cravings.

While you can't cut out stress completely, you can take steps to lower your stress levels, which in turn, can help you manage your cravings.\\n\\nTry relaxation techniques, such as yoga or meditation.\\nCut out stress when you can. For instance, if you find that you get stressed out watching the morning news, skip it.\\nWhen you're feeling stressed, try deep breathing. Close your eyes and inhale through your nose while counting to 4 in your head. Hold the breath for 4 counts, then breathe out through your mouth for 4 counts.

Turn off the electronics and start your wind-down then.\\nIf you have trouble staying asleep, cut out disturbances like light, noises, and pets.

Brown sugar or raw sugar will also work, but be prepared for a less predictable flavor due to the higher molasses content.\", \"Pour the sugar into a zip locked bag, a Tupperware container, a jar, or any other clean, airtight container. Because this method uses dry, powdered spices, there will be no need for a blender or other tool.\\nYou can easily make a larger or smaller batch with these same instructions. Just remember to multiply the amount of spice used as well.\", \"For this method, use a dry, ground or powdered spice (or grind the spice in a spice grinder or mortar). Different spices have different strengths, so feel free to experiment. The range given is a good starting point, from 2 tsp (10 mL) for a touch of flavor, up to 10 tsp (50 mL) for a strong flavor.\\n\\n\\n are all commonly used in desserts, making them an obvious option to pair with sugar. These work well alone or in any combination with each other.\\n\\n sugar is a flavor for the fearless, adding a bold garnish to a plate or cocktail.\\n\\n or other flavorful powders can also be added using this method. Try using 1/4 cup (60 mL) instead, since these tend to have a less concentrated flavor than spices.\", \"Close the airtight container and mix the sugar and spices together by shaking. Alternatively, mix with a fork or other utensil, but make sure the ingredients are evenly distributed before closing the container.\", \"The sugar will take time to absorb the surrounding flavors, becoming more potent over the course of the next few days. Since all the ingredients used in this method are dry, you may store this sugar in an ordinary shaker or sugar bowl.\"], [\"Any leafy herb or citrus zest can be added using this method. Here are a few ideas, along with estimated amounts to use for every 1 cup (240 mL) sugar:\\n\\n\\n are all aromatic flavors. Lavender will produce an especially strong scent. Set aside about 3 tablespoons (45 mL) per cup (240 mL) sugar.\\n\\n\\n makes a sugar that works well in baking and cocktails. Try using 1/2 cup (120 mL) of loosely packed mint leaves.\\n\\n\\n is a more unusual flavor for sweets, and may pair well with lime. Use about 1.5 tbsp (22 mL).\\n\\n\\n, or any other citrus fruit can be zest and added to sugar. Zest the fruit's colored outer rind, avoiding the white pith. Use the zest from two fruits for a moderate flavor, or several more for a stronger one.\", \"Fresh leaves and citrus rind should be dried before adding, to avoid clumping the sugar with moisture. There are several ways to accomplish this:\\n\\nLay them out on a layer of paper towels, without overlaps, and microwave in 30-second bursts. Check between each burst, and remove when the herbs are crisp.\\n\\nTurn an oven to the lowest setting, lay the herbs on a baking sheet, and warm for about 20 minutes, or until dry. Using an oven at a higher setting is not recommended, due to the risk of burning the herbs.\\n\\nLeave the herbs in a location with a light breeze, to dry for 8\\u201424 hours. Direct sunlight may reduce the flavor.\", \"Sugar will infuse much more quickly if the other ingredients are ground in a spice grinder or coffee grinder. This will also produce a more evenly colored and textured end product.\\n\\nA food processor might work, but it may not turn the ingredients fully into powder.\\n\\nIf using dried lavender, you may prefer to leave the flowers in the sugar whole, and strain them out before using the sugar. The lavender flowers (or scoops of the lavender sugar) can then be used to infuse a couple more batches of sugar before they lose their potency.\", \"White granulated sugar is less likely to clump than most other sugars, making it a good choice for these moisture-containing ingredients. Feel free to experiment with other options if you prefer.\", \"The sugar should infuse overnight, and continue to taste stronger over the course of the next few days. Store in a dry, airtight container to protect the sugar from humidity and microorganisms.\\nUse citrus zest sugar within two weeks.\"], [\"Almond extract, vanilla extract, and fruit extracts are simple ways to flavor sugar. Start by adding just two to four drops of extract per cup (240 mL) of sugar, since these flavors are concentrated. Stir thoroughly until the color is even, using a spoon to mash apart clumps of moist sugar.\", \"Slice a vanilla bean pod lengthwise and scoop out as much of the sticky, inner seed material as you can. Stir or blend this sticky material thoroughly with 2\\u20134 cups (480\\u2013960 mL) sugar, depending on how strong a flavor you desire. Add the bean pod itself to the sugar and store in an airtight container. Wait at least 48 hours before using, while the flavor infuses.\", \"You'd never thought of alcoholic sugar before, but now you're interested. Cocktail bitters usually have a strong flavor, so start with two or three teaspoons (10\\u201315 mL) per cup (240 mL) of sugar, and add more if necessary.\", \"Freeze-dried fruit can be ground in a spice grinder or coffee grinder, then mixed into sugar by hand. This will also add color to the sugar bowl more than most other flavors.\"], [\"Stir vanilla sugar or cocoa sugar into hot milk. Use mint or citrus sugar in iced tea or mojitos. Almost any flavored sugar can be used as cocktail garnish. Rub the rim of the glass with a lemon wedge, then sprinkle the sugar crystals over it.\", \"Many spices and extracts used to flavor sugar are already used in desserts. Replace the ordinary sugar in a baking recipe, or make the flavor more obvious by topping muffins, rice pudding, or parfait. Use citrus sugar instead for a complementary sour tinge.\", \"Granulated sugar can be formed into sugar cubes by adding about 1 tsp (5 mL) water for every 1/2 cup (120 mL) sugar. Add more water or sugar as necessary in tiny amounts, stirring thoroughly, until the sugar is slightly moist and crumbly. Press this into a miniature ice cube tray for a typical sugar cube, or into any silicone mold for more unusual shapes. Leave out at room temperature until hard (one to eight hours), then transfer to an airtight container.\\n\\nIf you don't have molds, you can press the wet sugar flat on a wax paper-lined baking pan. Cut it into a grid pattern (or into any shapes), then let dry.\\nYou can combine this step with the flavoring by substituting half the water with extract or cocktail bitters.\", \"Tie a string to a pencil, placed over a clean, glass jar. Heat the flavored sugar in a pot of water to make a simple syrup, then pour it into the jar. If you used any flavoring larger than a powder, you might want to strain the syrup through a mesh as you pour.\", \"If you used wet flavor ingredients, give the sugar at least two weeks to dry before using it for cotton candy.

Superfine sugar reduces the risk of crystallization. A raw brown sugar such as turbinado or demerara creates a brown, molasses-flavored syrup good for rum or bourbon cocktails.\\nDo not use confectioner's sugar (powdered sugar). This usually contains cornstarch, which does not dissolve in water. The syrup will be cloudy or grainy.\", \"Measure the sugar and water and combine in a saucepan. Use an equal amount of both ingredients for a basic syrup. For a more concentrated syrup, use up to twice as much sugar as water.\\n\\nA more concentrated syrup has a higher risk of crystallizing back into solids, but will last longer in the fridge. Some bartenders prefer a concentrated syrup because it can sweeten a cocktail without adding too much water.\\nFor greater accuracy, measure ingredients by weight on a kitchen scale. Using volume measurements (cups or milliliters) won't cause major issue, but you'll end up with about \\u215e the amount of sugar.\", \"Turn on the heat under your sugar-water mixture. Stir until all the sugar crystals have dissolved. The sugar usually dissolves within a few minutes, but a large batch may take longer.\\n\\nDo not let the mixture boil. If you lose too much water, the sugar may not be able to dissolve.\\nFor very concentrated syrups (at least a 2:1 ratio of sugar to water), stir the last bits of water gently. Too much stirring when the maximum amount of sugar has dissolved can cause crystals to reform.\", \"A single grain of sugar left in the syrup can create a large mass of solid crystals. If you see any sugar left on the side of the pot, brush it down to the syrup using a wet pastry brush. Alternatively, just put the lid on the pot for a few minutes, and the condensed water should run down the sides and clean them.\\nBecause the lid traps most of the water vapor, it's all right if the syrup boils for a short time while the lid is on. To be safe, stick with a brief simmer.\", \"it will be ready to store once it reaches room temperature.\\nIf the sugar crystallizes when it cools, either too much water boiled away, or not all the sugar dissolved. Add a little water and heat it up again.\", \"Bring a small, separate pot of water to a boil. Once boiled, pour directly into a clean jar or bottle. Pour boiling water over the lid of the container as well. Sterilizing the container will reduce the chance that your syrup re-crystallizes, and prolong shelf life.\\nUnless using immediately, store in a clear container so you can watch for signs of mold.\", \"Dump the hot water out of the container, and immediately pour in the room temperature syrup. Fasten the lid and store in the refrigerator.\\n\\nA 1:1 syrup stays good for about one month.\\nA 2:1 syrup stays good for about six months.\\nTo keep your syrup useful for much longer, stir in a spoonful of high-proof vodka.\"], [\"Sugar will dissolve in room temperature water, if you shake it hard enough. Because there's no heat to sterilize the syrup, this version will only last about two weeks. As far as taste goes, bartenders have lined up on both sides of the hot-cold debate. Give it a whirl and decide for yourself: \\n\\nCombine equal parts sugar and water in a sealed container. (Using superfine sugar may shorten the shaking time.)\\n\\nShake for three minutes, then let rest for one minute.\\nShake for another 30 seconds, or until all sugar is dissolved.\", \"Simmer the syrup with herbs or spices for about 30\\u201345 minutes to extract flavors. Try cinnamon and nutmeg syrup for winter holiday desserts, or basil syrup for sophisticated cocktails.\\n\\nIf using herbs, remove them as soon as they turn brown. Strain out leaves once the syrup is done.\\nThe addition of other ingredients may shorten the shelf life. Stir a spoonful of vodka into the cooled syrup to prevent mold.\", \"Adding gum arabic to the syrup creates a silky texture, and lowers the chance of crystallization. This old-fashioned recipe is making a small comeback due to the appealing texture it lends to cocktails:\\n\\nBring water nearly to a boil. Slowly mix in an equal amount gum arabic, by weight. Stir until gluey and mostly combined.\\nLet sit for two to three hours, off the heat. Stir again to work in lumps.\\nStart making sugar syrup, as above. Use twice as much water as you did for the gum arabic.\\nOnce sugar is dissolved, reduce to a simmer. Stir in gum arabic mixture slowly, while stirring.\\nLet cool, then skim off and discard scum from the top of the syrup.\", \"Add this dark caramel flavor to whiskey cocktails or a bittersweet chocolate cake. Wear gloves and stand back from the pan, as molten sugar can cause severe burns. Try it out as follows:\\n\\nHeat the sugar (alone) in a stainless steel saucepan, stirring once every 30 seconds.\\nFor caramel syrup: Add water as soon as the sugar melts. This will cause spattering and steaming, so stand back as you pour. Stir rapidly and constantly until syrup forms.\\nFor burnt caramel syrup: Turn on stove ventilation or open windows \\u2014 there will likely be smoke. Wait until sugar forms thick bubbles, than (in another 15 seconds or so) turns dark. Add water and stir carefully.
