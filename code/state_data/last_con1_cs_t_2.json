Plastic interior trim panels, for instance, are often held in place by small tabs, so a bit of squeezing, pulling, and wiggling will usually work them free. However, to reduce your chance of breaking something, read your owner's manual carefully for instructions on removing interior panels.\\nAlthough removing components to paint them can be time-consuming, it's safer to paint them this way, and they'll look better in the end.\", \"You'll often have to pop off plastic sections near the window, door handle, and/or speakers to reveal the screws holding the panel in place. Once you remove all the mounting screws with a screwdriver, you can pull off the panel and disconnect any wiring for the speaker, windows, etc.\\n\\nEach grouping of wires will be connected to the door with a plastic clip that will pop right out when you squeeze and pull on it.\\nRemoving a door panel usually requires a step-by-step approach, so follow the instructions for your specific vehicle carefully.\", \"If you start trying to pull off steering wheel panels without knowing what you're doing, you could easily be injured by an unexpectedly-deployed airbag. Read your owner's manual in great detail before attempting to remove any steering wheel components for painting.\\n\\nGenerally speaking, you should disconnect your car battery and wait at least 30 minutes before attempting to remove any steering wheel panels. After that, you may need to disconnect the airbag (possibly from the underside of the steering column) and remove the airbag chamber, cover and all, from the steering wheel.\\nIf you are at all uncertain how to do this, let a professional handle this part of the job. It can cost up to $1000 USD to replace a broken airbag system.\", \"In many cases, car seats are held in place by 4 bolts total, 1 at each end of the 2 rails the seats slide on. Remove these with a socket wrench, tip the chair back, and squeeze and pull any plastic clips holding wiring (for seat adjusters, etc.) in place. Then remove the seat.\\nPainting fabric seats while they're still in the car usually causes a mess and can expose you to higher concentrations of chemical fumes. Take the time to read your manual and remove the seats properly before painting them.\", \"Once the seats are out, remove and/or cover any plastic, metal, or other components you don't want to paint. Use a combination of painter's tape and plastic shopping bags to mask those areas.\", \"If you choose to paint interior components without removing them, be extremely thorough in masking over surfaces that you don't want to be painted\\u2014for instance, the gauges, the stereo, the windshield and mirror, and so on. Apply painter's tape to create sharp edge lines between painted and non-painted areas, and tape sheets of plastic (or plastic shopping bags) that have been cut to fit over larger areas that you don't want painted.\\nWhenever possible, spray components outside the car, so you aren't dealing with concentrated fumes. No matter if you're spraying inside or outside the car, though, work in a well-ventilated area and wear a mask.\"], [\"Add a squirt of dish soap to a bucket of warm water. Dip an ultra-fine-grit cleaning pad (e.g., a gray Scotch Brite scouring pad) into the water and wash the components thoroughly.\\n\\nDon't use steel wool, sandpaper, or heavier-grit cleaning pads, as these will scuff up the plastic or vinyl too much.\\nYou want to just barely scuff the surface to help the paint adhere, and remove surface dirt and grime.\", \"If you have compressed air available in your workshop, or have a spray can of it handy, use it to blow-dry the pieces you've washed. Compressed air will dry the parts quickly and remove any dust created by the cleaning pad.\\nIf you don't have compressed air, let the parts air dry, or wipe them down with a lint-free cloth. Then wipe over everything with a tack cloth to remove any dust.\", \"Trisodium phosphate (TSP) comes in powdered form and must be mixed with water according to the package instructions. It is also a very potent cleaner, so you must wear long clothing, eye protection, a breathing mask, and rubber gloves, and work in a well ventilated area. Mix up only as much as you need and wipe down the parts with a cloth dampened with TSP, then let the parts air dry.\\n\\nIf you have vinyl components and would prefer not to work with TSP, you can find aerosol vinyl prep cleaner sprays at automotive stores. Just spray on a thin coat, let it set up for about 30 seconds, then wipe it off with a lint-free cloth.\\n\\nIf you want a TSP alternative for plastic parts, use denatured alcohol. Dampen a clean cloth with the alcohol, wipe down the components thoroughly, and let them air dry.\\n\\nNo matter which product you use, follow all listed safety precautions and work in a ventilated area.\", \"Use a vacuum with powerful suction and remove every bit of dirt and debris that you can from the fabric. For heavily-soiled seats, you may want to use a steam cleaner, then let them dry and follow up with the vacuum.\\nIf your fabric has a suede finish with a grain to it, brush the grain in its natural direction after vacuuming it and before painting it.\"], [\"Filler primers are formulated to smooth out small scratches and cracks in plastic parts. Depending on the product instructions, you may need to apply multiple layers of the primer to achieve the desired effect.\\n\\nFiller primers can be found with other spray primers and paints. Look for one specifically formulated for automotive uses, if possible.\\nNo filler primer can make deep scratches or cracks disappear, but they may become less noticeable.\\nFiller primers won't work on flexible materials like vinyl or fabric.\", \"This can be particularly useful for vinyl components, as it will help the spray paint adhere to the slick, flexible material. Look for it alongside other automotive primer sprays.\\n\\nYou can use this for plastic parts as well, if you don't need a filler primer.\\nDon't use a primer of any type on fabric before painting it.\", \"A sheltered spot with lots of airflow but minimal wind is ideal for spray priming and painting. Try a garage with all the doors and windows open, for instance. And always wear a breathing mask while spray painting to reduce your intake of fumes and particles.\\nAlso put down drop cloths, pieces of cardboard, or other protection against overspray.\", \"Follow the instructions on the can. Generally speaking, though, you'll shake the can for 1 minute; hold the can 6\\u20138 inches (15\\u201320\\u00a0cm) from the object; and spray in bursts over the surface of the object, keeping the can in motion as you spray.\\n\\nDon't hold the can in one spot, or you'll end up with splotches or bubbles on the surface.\\nApply 1, 2, or more coats as directed. For multiple coats, wait the recommended time between applications (usually 5-15 minutes).\"], [\"Plastic parts should be sprayed with a paint labeled for use on plastic. Vinyl or fabric parts should likewise be sprayed with a vinyl or fabric paint, respectively. If possible, choose spray paints designed for use on automotive components.\\nVinyl and fabric spray paints are able to flex along with those materials. A paint designed for plastic will crack and flake off of vinyl or fabric.\", \"Spraying on the paint involves the same process as applying primer. Shake the can as directed (usually for 1 minute), hold it 6\\u20138 inches (15\\u201320\\u00a0cm) from the object, and apply thin coats with bursts of spray while you move the can over the surface.\\n\\nWait approximately 10-15 minutes between coats\\u2014follow the package instructions.\\nIt may take 3-4 coats, or even more, to adequately cover some components. Applying numerous thin coats produces far superior results to trying to spray on 1 or 2 thick coats.\\nNo matter how many coats of spray paint you apply to fabric, you may never achieve ideal results that cover every spot on the fabric. This is especially true for suede fabric. Therefore, it's best to temper your expectations somewhat before painting interior fabric, or to let a pro do the job for you.\", \"Clear coat will add a little extra shine and protection to your paint job. Apply it in the same way as the paint, but take special care to apply thin, even coats over the surface of the object. Otherwise, you may notice streaks or differences in the level of gloss on the finished product.\\nWhile you might wait 5-15 minutes between coats of primer or paint, it's better to wait the full 15 minutes (or even a little longer) between applications of clear coat.\", \"No matter the material, and regardless of whether you applied clear coat or not, it's best to keep your hands off the paint job for at least a day. This will permit the paint to dry fully and remove any tackiness from the surface.\\nA good-quality fabric paint should not leave any discoloration on a white cloth pressed to it after 24 hours. If it does, and the fabric is on a seat, you'll have little choice but to either replace the seat or find a seat cover that will prevent stains on your clothing.\", \"After 24 hours, peel off any painter's tape and plastic you used for masking purposes. Then, using your owner's manual as a guide, reinstall any removed components in the reverse order from how you took them out. For instance:\\n\\nLift the seats into place, push in any plastic clips to reconnect any wiring, and reinstall the bolts (there are usually 4) with a socket wrench.\\nReconnect the steering wheel's airbag and any components you removed very carefully according to your owner's manual, or have a professional do it.\\nLift the door panels into place, connect the wiring by pushing the plastic clips in place, reinstall the mounting screws with a screwdriver, and pop in any plastic panels near the windows, handles, etc.\\nPop in any plastic trim pieces held in place by plastic tabs.\"]],

Not only will these better endure the repeated use of harsh chemicals, but also come with side-markings which will be invaluable when it comes time to measure your paint.\", \"Selecting the paint you will work with is more than simply choosing a pleasant colour. Different kinds of paint do different jobs.Single-stage paints are those which can be used independently, without an extra base or finishing layer. A good comparison is to nail polish. You can apply as many or as few layers as you wish, with nothing else being required.\\nSingle-stage paints are recommended for basic colours such as red, blue, or yellow. They dry to a glossy finish and are easy to prepare, so are perfect for the novice painter. Note, however, that these are rarely used to coat an entire car.\", \"Two-stage or base coat/clear coat paints will involve at least two coats (one base, one clear). The base coat provides the colour, while the clear coat provides extra protection against scratches and the elements.\\nA two-stage method tends to yield a more metallic finish. If this, along with greater protection, appeals to you, then opt for a compound coat.\", \"Whatever you choose, try not to vary your paint types or brands, as this can create an uneven result. If you don't know which paint or method is best suited to your vehicle, consult your owner's manual or local car dealer to find out.\", \"When mixing paint, you need to know what additional materials are required, as well as any safety precautions to take into consideration. However, this information is not difficult to find. Simply inspect the side of the can.\\n\\nIf the technical data specifies the use of paint thinner and/or paint hardener, these will need to be purchased as well.\\nIn the unlikely event that this information is not printed on the can, go to the manufacturer's website or contact the retail outlet where the paint was bought.\"], [\"Single-stage paint will usually require the mixture of three basic substances.\\n\\nThe paint itself will determine the colour of your mixture.\\n'Reducer' or 'thinner' serves to dilute the paint, avoiding solid clumps or \\\"orange peels\\\" in your coat.\\n'Hardener' will help your paint dry for a convenient finish.\", \"The paint's technical information will inform you of what ratio of materials are needed, written as a series of 3 numbers. For example, a standard mixing ratio for single-stage paints is an 8/1/1 mixture. That is to say, for every 8 parts paint add one part thinner and one part hardener.\\nIf you are using a paint mixing cup there will be fractions which correspond to this ratio. So, you might fill the cup with paint to the '8' level, use thinner to reach '9,' and top it up to '10' with hardener.\", \"Paint sticks can be acquired from any trade store, otherwise a sturdy piece of wood or old tool will suffice to stir the mixture. Do so thoroughly to create the appropriate consistency.\\nWhatever you use to mix the paint with will be ruined, so choose something that will not be missed.\", \"Add a small amount of the paint to the gun, and have a disposable surface set aside to test the suitability of your newly mixed paint.\\n\\nIf the paint is not flowing well from the spray gun, add more thinner to increase the flow.\\nIf having sprayed the surface you see that the paint is running, or is having trouble drying, this is an indication that more hardener is required.\"], [\"Both the base coat paint and clear coat paint will require pairing with an additional substance.\\n\\nBase coat paint will be paired with reducer or thinner to ensure the best viscosity.\\nClear coat paint must be combined with hardener before being applied to your car's surface.\", \"Refer to the technical information you sourced earlier to determine the ratios for each coat.\\n\\nThe ratio of base coat paint to reducer will always be 1/1. Your container, preferably a mixing pail, should therefore be half paint and half thinner.\\nYour clear coat will be slightly more complicated. Depending on the brand, the ratio of clear coat paint to hardener will usually be either 4/1 or 2/1.\", \"Using a paint stick or similar tool, stir the contents until they appear smooth.

You can pick up dust masks and safety gloves at almost any hardware store.\", \"Wrap your sandpaper around a squeegee or sponge to create a flat sanding surface. Move the sandpaper in a circular motion while applying light pressure to the surface of the car. Use a dual-action sander if you\\u2019re working over a large surface area. If the paint isn\\u2019t affected by your sanding, increase the applied pressure until you begin to see paint being removed. You can buy or possibly rent a power sander from most hardware stores. Of course, it\\u2019s also perfectly fine to sand the surface by hand.Tip: If you\\u2019re sanding more than one large panel of the car, swap out the sandpaper in between the panels to ensure you\\u2019re not working with a smooth piece of sandpaper.\", \"Use a dry towel or microfiber cloth to remove any particles from the surface you\\u2019re working on.

Be sure to sand using small, circular motions to avoid sanding the surrounding areas of the car. Make sure to keep the sandpaper flat as you sand the surface of the car. As your arm becomes tired, you may begin to emphasize the edge of the paper, which will produce an uneven finish. It\\u2019s especially important to smooth out the surface of the sanded area if you intend to repaint and reseal it.\", \"Use a towel or microfiber cloth to remove the leftover dust and grit from the surface of the car. Then, use ordinary automotive soap and water to wash the area. Finally, spray down the sanded surface with a hose to get rid of any fine particulates and soapy residue. Be sure to rinse this area as thoroughly as possible, in order to avoid accidentally painting over dust or dirt.\", \"Apply 3 coats of automotive primer to the car surface with a spray gun or brush, waiting 15 minutes between each coat.

However, for larger areas, it\\u2019s best to use a spray gun. For best results, apply at least 2 coats of paint, waiting 10 minutes in between each coat. If you\\u2019ve sanded the surface of the car so far down that you see bare metal, you\\u2019ll definitely have to repaint it. However, if the original finish is still intact after this process, feel free to skip this step.

The basic steps involve sanding the affected area to remove the top layers of paint, rinsing after sanding, then spraying on primer. Once the primer has dried, spray on the right color auto paint.

You'll find more detailed help here: How to Remove Rust from a Car. Sandpaper off the rust before painting, then use rust-proof primer before adding the appropriate color of auto paint.

Your home garage may fit the bill, but do not paint in your garage if it contains a water heater, furnace, or other source of potential ignition for the paint fumes that will accumulate during the process.\\n\\nIt may be illegal where you live to paint a vehicle in your garage. Check with the local authorities before proceeding.\\nCovering the interior of your workspace with plastic sheeting can limit overspray and reduce the amount of dust that may fall on your new paint job while it cures.\", \"When you head to the home center, paint shop, and/or auto parts store to pick up the sprayer, primer, paint, sanding tools, and other necessary materials for the job, make sure not to neglect health and safety equipment. First and foremost, buy a respirator mask and make sure you know how to use it properly.\\n\\nChoose a respirator that is designed and marketed for use in vehicle painting.\\nAdditionally, wear safety goggles, nitrile gloves, and disposable plastic coveralls with a hood whenever you\\u2019re removing the old paint or adding the new stuff.\", \"You\\u2019ll typically find the color code on the \\u201ccompliance plate\\u201d located under the hood\\u2014it also contains the VIN number and other essential vehicle info. The color code may also be noted on the inside of the driver\\u2019s side door frame, near where you\\u2019ll find info on things like the ideal tire pressure for your vehicle.\\n\\nTake the color code to any retailer that supplies automotive paint to get the right match.\\nIf you can\\u2019t find the code, contact the vehicle manufacturer so you can get the correct code.\\nAlternatively, some automotive supply shops may be able to color match the paint without the code.\\nIt can be really hard to match the color of a paint job if you don\\u2019t get the exact type of paint that was used before. You can hide a small scratch or something with a similar color, but your eyes will still be able to spot the difference.\"], [\"Many of the body panel moldings used on cars can be \\u201csnapped\\u201d off and snapped back on easily, but if a gentle attempt to remove it is not successful, do not try to force it off. Auto supply stores often sell tools that aid in the process of removing trim.\\n\\nRefer to your vehicle manual for info on properly removing trim pieces.\\nAny trim pieces that refuse to come off can be taped over instead.\", \"Put on your respirator, overalls, gloves, and safety goggles, and use a metal grinder to grind away all of the rust. If you end up with any small holes, use a putty knife to apply a non-rusting auto body filler, then smooth out the patch material when you move on to sanding.\\n\\nIf you paint over rust, it\\u2019s just going to spread over time.\\n\\nFor larger rust holes, you\\u2019ll have to get more creative. Some auto enthusiasts create patches out of cut pieces of beer or soda cans, or thin sheets of semi-rigid plastic. These are adhered in place with auto body filler, then slowly sanded down smooth.\", \"You can, if necessary, only sand down to the primer layer, or even just sand down the finished coats enough for the new paint to stick. However, you\\u2019ll always get a better finished look if you take the time to sand the entire car down to the bare metal. Use a dual-action (DA) power sander with a 400 or 600-grit pad and work in circular motions with constant movement.\\n\\nA 600-grit pad will take longer to do the job, but will also reduce the chances of scratching and etching the surface more than desired.\\nYour aim is for a matte finish on the bare metal, not to polish it smooth.\\nAlways wear your safety equipment, most especially eye protection and your respirator, when sanding.\", \"Use tack cloths to remove visible surface dust, then wipe every surface of the vehicle with rags dampened with paint thinner, mineral spirits, or denatured alcohol. This wipedown will remove any remaining dust and clean away any oils from the surface.\\n\\nDon\\u2019t mix surface cleaning materials. If you start out using paint thinner, clean the entire car with rags dampened only with paint thinner.\\nGive the vehicle surfaces 5-10 minutes to dry before taping off the areas you don\\u2019t want to paint.\", \"For instance, you\\u2019ll need to mask off the window glass, window trim, and mirrors, and may also need to cover things like the door handles and grills.

Always maintain this sweeping motion while spraying.\\n\\nA scrap car door from a local junkyard is the best practice material. However, a sheet of scrap steel will also do the job.

It will take longer to do the job, but you\\u2019ll be less likely to sand off too much.\\nRemember that your goal is just to remove the powdery finish, not to expose the bare metal beneath the primer.\", \"Use clean rags slightly dampened with a wax and grease remover, acetone, or paint thinner.

Read your owner's manual in great detail before attempting to remove any steering wheel components for painting.\\n\\nGenerally speaking, you should disconnect your car battery and wait at least 30 minutes before attempting to remove any steering wheel panels. After that, you may need to disconnect the airbag (possibly from the underside of the steering column) and remove the airbag chamber, cover and all, from the steering wheel.\\nIf you are at all uncertain how to do this, let a professional handle this part of the job. It can cost up to $1000 USD to replace a broken airbag system.\", \"In many cases, car seats are held in place by 4 bolts total, 1 at each end of the 2 rails the seats slide on. Remove these with a socket wrench, tip the chair back, and squeeze and pull any plastic clips holding wiring (for seat adjusters, etc.) in place. Then remove the seat.\\nPainting fabric seats while they're still in the car usually causes a mess and can expose you to higher concentrations of chemical fumes.

Just spray on a thin coat, let it set up for about 30 seconds, then wipe it off with a lint-free cloth.\\n\\nIf you want a TSP alternative for plastic parts, use denatured alcohol.

Applying numerous thin coats produces far superior results to trying to spray on 1 or 2 thick coats.\\nNo matter how many coats of spray paint you apply to fabric, you may never achieve ideal results that cover every spot on the fabric. This is especially true for suede fabric. Therefore, it's best to temper your expectations somewhat before painting interior fabric, or to let a pro do the job for you.\", \"Clear coat will add a little extra shine and protection to your paint job. Apply it in the same way as the paint, but take special care to apply thin, even coats over the surface of the object. Otherwise, you may notice streaks or differences in the level of gloss on the finished product.\\nWhile you might wait 5-15 minutes between coats of primer or paint, it's better to wait the full 15 minutes (or even a little longer) between applications of clear coat.\", \"No matter the material, and regardless of whether you applied clear coat or not, it's best to keep your hands off the paint job for at least a day. This will permit the paint to dry fully and remove any tackiness from the surface.\\nA good-quality fabric paint should not leave any discoloration on a white cloth pressed to it after 24 hours. If it does, and the fabric is on a seat, you'll have little choice but to either replace the seat or find a seat cover that will prevent stains on your clothing.\", \"After 24 hours, peel off any painter's tape and plastic you used for masking purposes. Then, using your owner's manual as a guide, reinstall any removed components in the reverse order from how you took them out.

airbag and any components you removed very carefully according to your owner's manual, or have a professional do it.\\nLift the door panels into place, connect the wiring by pushing the plastic clips

Once your car is free of dirt and dust, allow it to air dry before airbrushing it.\", \"Because an airbrush paints a large area at a time, it's important that you tape off decals or designs that you want to paint in later. Once you've achieved the car has dried, you can remove the painter's tape and fill in finer details with a more precise tool like a brush.\", \"In order to quickly airbrush your car, it will need to be suspended in the air. Use a bent wire hanger as a base and stand for your model car, attaching the stand to the car from the inside. As an alternative, you can also find a stable and flat pillar to set your car on top of as you paint. Make sure to attach the car to the stand using masking tape.\", \"\", \"\", \"Connect the paint jar color that you want to use to your airbrush. Apply the first base coat with your airbrush by applying pressure to the actuator, or button on the top of the airbrush. Quickly move your hand left to right and apply mist coats at 25-30 PSI. Continue to rotate your model car as you apply more coats of paint. When you are nearing the end, lower the PSI on your airbrush to 18-20 PSI to apply the final one or two coats.\\n\\nLowering the airbrush PSI will make the paint come out thicker.\\nDo not let the thick paint run, or it may ruin your model. Be conservative on thick coats of paint.\\nRemember to airbrush separate parts of your car, such as the hood, as you paint the car's body.\", \"Dry your car model for 24-48 hours before handling it. Keep the car in a cool area free of sunlight while it dries. Once it's totally dried, examine the car and look for areas that are not painted.

If you\\u2019re in a garage, keep the door open.\\nSpread a sheet under the car to catch any falling debris.\", \"A dual-action sander uses compressed air to spin the sanding surface. Start with a coarse, 40-grit sandpaper. This strips off the top layer of paint.\\n\\nYou can buy or rent sanders from a hardware store.\\nYou can also use a grinder. This strips the paint off much faster. However, it can also damage the metal. Always keep the grinder moving and don\\u2019t hover over one spot to avoid denting the bare metal.\\nAnother option is sanding by hand, without an electric sander. This is extremely time-consuming, but you will save money. Also, sanding by hand is a better option if you own a classic car to avoid damaging the body. Use a sanding block at the same grit levels as you use for the electric sander.\", \"Flat surfaces like the hood or roof are the easiest to sand, so start here. Start the sander and press it down on the car surface with even pressure. Leaning the sander to one side could cause denting. Slide the sander slowly across the car and let it grind off the paint as you move.\\n\\nIf the car has only been painted once, you\\u2019ll see the white primer and then bare metal. If there are multiple paint layers, spend more time on each section to strip it away.\\nSome spots may be tougher than others. If the paint won\\u2019t come off in one spot, keep the sander there for a few seconds to work the paint off.\\nReplace the sandpaper when it gets too dull. You\\u2019ll notice that it doesn\\u2019t strip the paint as well after a while. This means it\\u2019s time for a new piece of paper.\", \"Once you've tackled the larger areas, move on to tight areas like the ones around the doors. These are tougher to reach, so try opening doors and the trunk to get into tight spots. Angle your sander so it fits into these areas.\\n\\nSpread a sheet inside your car to protect the interior from dust and debris.\\nIf there are tight areas at angles you can't reach, try using a sand block on these spots instead.\", \"After finishing with the 40-grit paper, wipe the car down with a moist rag to remove any dust. Then load finer-grit paper onto the sander. Do another sanding round with 120, 220, and 400-grit paper.\\n\\nRemember to wipe the car down in-between each sanding session.\\nThis process removes small sections of oxidation and rust that you can\\u2019t see with the naked eye. Leaving these on the car\\u2019s surface could damage a new paint layer over time.\", \"Use water and soap to remove any dirt and debris. Then let the car dry completely.\\n\\nFor a faster job, you can also wipe the car down with mineral spirits rather than wash it with soap and water.\\nOnce all the paint is off and the car is clean, continue with painting the car.\\nIf you\\u2019re going to paint the car, apply primer as soon as the car is dry to prevent rusting.\"], [\"Stripping paint with chemicals is messy.

Be sure to sand using small, circular motions to avoid sanding the surrounding areas of the car. Make sure to keep the sandpaper flat as you sand the surface of the car. As your arm becomes tired, you may begin to emphasize the edge of the paper, which will produce an uneven finish. It\\u2019s especially important to smooth out the surface of the sanded area if you intend to repaint and reseal it.\", \"Use a towel or microfiber cloth to remove the leftover dust and grit from the surface of the car. Then, use ordinary automotive soap and water to wash the area. Finally, spray down the sanded surface with a hose to get rid of any fine particulates and soapy residue. Be sure to rinse this area as thoroughly as possible, in order to avoid accidentally painting over dust or dirt.\", \"Apply 3 coats of automotive primer to the car surface with a spray gun or brush, waiting 15 minutes between each coat. Once the final coat has dried, use a spray can to repaint the car with horizontal strokes. If you\\u2019re only working on a small surface area, you may be able to apply the primer with a hand brush. However, for larger areas, it\\u2019s best to use a spray gun. For best results, apply at least 2 coats of paint, waiting 10 minutes in between each coat. If you\\u2019ve sanded the surface of the car so far down that you see bare metal, you\\u2019ll definitely have to repaint it. However, if the original finish is still intact after this process, feel free to skip this step.

If you\\u2019re working with sand or plastic, go with a size somewhere between size 40 and size 12 for best results.Tip: A small, handheld compressor works great for relatively small areas of a car. However, if you need to blast the whole chassis, you may need to rent a large tow-behind compressor and blaster or take your car in to a professional.\", \"Hold the compressor about 12 to 14 inches (30 to 36 cm) away from the surface of the car.

If you blast one particular area for too long, you may end up damaging the metal underneath the paint.\", \"Stop blasting the car as soon as the paint is removed in order to avoid damaging the metal underneath. If the surface is rough and jagged, sand it with 80- to 100-grit sandpaper to smooth it out.\", \"Use a spray gun to apply 3 coats of automotive primer to the blasted surface as soon as possible in order to prevent the formation of rust. Then, repaint the area with 2 coats of spray paint to match the surrounding parts of the car.

It often comes in small jars of the paint or in paint pens.\\nIt's important to get an exact match to your car's color, so don't settle on a color that is just close to your car's.\\nLight-colored cars can be difficult to find a perfect color match. Consult an auto paint specialist if you are having difficulty finding the right color.\", \"Before touching the chipped area up, it\\u2019s important to prevent rust from spreading underneath your touch-up job in the future.

This will be fixed by the top coat you will apply over the whole area.\", \"Paint the top coat over the entire area that is discolored. Typically this includes the chipped area and the existing paint surrounding it that has been lightly sanded.

Whatever you decide, painting a model car enables you to use your creativity to create your own personalized model.\", \"summaryVideoUrl\": null, \"tipsWarnings\": {\"py/id\": 624}, \"tools\": {\"py/id\": 625}, \"topLevelCategories\": {\"py/id\": 627}, \"updated\": \"September 5, 2019\", \"views\": 75242, \"votes\": 69}, \"_type\": \"_doc\", \"original_rank\": 6, \"reranking_score\": 6.323055267333984}, {\"_id\": \"11340\", \"_index\": \"wikihow-v3\", \"_score\": 9.447212, \"_source\": {\"QAs\": {\"py/id\": 628}, \"articleId\": 11340, \"articleTitle\": \"How to Strip Paint From Your Car\", \"articleUrl\": \"https://www.wikihow.com/Strip-Paint-From-Your-Car\", \"author\": {\"blurb\": null, \"n_coauthors\": 5, \"name\": \"wikiHow Staff Editor\"}, \"hasParts\": false, \"hasSummary\": true, \"ingredients\": {\"py/id\": 631}, \"methods\": {\"py/id\": 632}, \"methodsHeadlines\": {\"py/id\": 635}, \"methodsImages\": {\"py/id\": 638}, \"methodsNames\": {\"py/id\": 641}, \"otherLanguages\": {\"Deutsch\": {\"title\": \"Lack vom Auto entfernen\", \"url\": \"https://de.wikihow.com/Lack-vom-Auto-entfernen\"}, \"Espa\\u00f1ol\": {\"title\": \"quitar la pintura de tu auto\", \"url\": \"https://es.wikihow.com/quitar-la-pintura-de-tu-auto\"}, \"Portugu\\u00eas\": {\"title\": \"Remover a Pintura do Carro\", \"url\": \"https://pt.wikihow.com/Remover-a-Pintura-do-Carro\"}, \"\\u0420\\u0443\\u0441\\u0441\\u043a\\u0438\\u0439\": {\"title\": \"\\u0443\\u0434\\u0430\\u043b\\u0438\\u0442\\u044c \\u043a\\u0440\\u0430\\u0441\\u043a\\u0443 \\u0441 \\u0430\\u0432\\u0442\\u043e\\u043c\\u043e\\u0431\\u0438\\u043b\\u044f\", \"url\": \"https://ru.wikihow.com/%D1%83%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%8C-%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BA%D1%83-%D1%81-%D0%B0%D0%B2%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%8F\"}}, \"quizzes\": {\"py/id\": 642}, \"rating\": 100, \"refs\": {\"py/id\": 643}, \"relatedArticles\": {\"py/id\": 644}, \"summaryText\": \"Removing old paint from your car is a crucial step before you apply a fresh coat of paint.

Once you remove all the mounting screws with a screwdriver, you can pull off the panel and disconnect any wiring for the speaker, windows, etc.\\n\\nEach grouping of wires will be connected to the door with a plastic clip that will pop right out when you squeeze and pull on it.\\nRemoving a door panel usually requires a step-by-step approach, so follow the instructions for your specific vehicle carefully.\", \"If you start trying to pull off steering wheel panels without knowing what you're doing, you could easily be injured by an unexpectedly-deployed airbag. Read your owner's manual in great detail before attempting to remove any steering wheel components for painting.\\n\\nGenerally speaking, you should disconnect your car battery and wait at least 30 minutes before attempting to remove any steering wheel panels. After that, you may need to disconnect the airbag (possibly from the underside of the steering column) and remove the airbag chamber, cover and all, from the steering wheel.\\nIf you are at all uncertain how to do this, let a professional handle this part of the job. It can cost up to $1000 USD to replace a broken airbag system.\", \"In many cases, car seats are held in place by 4 bolts total, 1 at each end of the 2 rails the seats slide on. Remove these with a socket wrench, tip the chair back, and squeeze and pull any plastic clips holding wiring (for seat adjusters, etc.) in place. Then remove the seat.\\nPainting fabric seats while they're still in the car usually causes a mess and can expose you to higher concentrations of chemical fumes. Take the time to read your manual and remove the seats properly before painting them.\", \"Once the seats are out, remove and/or cover any plastic, metal, or other components you don't want to paint. Use a combination of painter's tape and plastic shopping bags to mask those areas.\", \"If you choose to paint interior components without removing them, be extremely thorough in masking over surfaces that you don't want to be painted\\u2014for instance, the gauges, the stereo, the windshield and mirror, and so on. Apply painter's tape to create sharp edge lines between painted and non-painted areas, and tape sheets of plastic (or plastic shopping bags) that have been cut to fit over larger areas that you don't want painted.\\nWhenever possible, spray components outside the car, so you aren't dealing with concentrated fumes. No matter if you're spraying inside or outside the car, though, work in a well-ventilated area and wear a mask.\"], [\"Add a squirt of dish soap to a bucket of warm water. Dip an ultra-fine-grit cleaning pad (e.g., a gray Scotch Brite scouring pad) into the water and wash the components thoroughly.\\n\\nDon't use steel wool, sandpaper, or heavier-grit cleaning pads, as these will scuff up the plastic or vinyl too much.\\nYou want to just barely scuff the surface to help the paint adhere, and remove surface dirt and grime.\", \"If you have compressed air available in your workshop, or have a spray can of it handy, use it to blow-dry the pieces you've washed.

Then wipe over everything with a tack cloth to remove any dust.\", \"Trisodium phosphate (TSP) comes in powdered form and must be mixed with water according to the package instructions. It is also a very potent cleaner, so you must wear long clothing, eye protection, a breathing mask, and rubber gloves, and work in a well ventilated area. Mix up only as much as you need and wipe down the parts with a cloth dampened with TSP, then let the parts air dry.\\n\\nIf you have vinyl components and would prefer not to work with TSP, you can find aerosol vinyl prep cleaner sprays at automotive stores. Just spray on a thin coat, let it set up for about 30 seconds, then wipe it off with a lint-free cloth.\\n\\nIf you want a TSP alternative for plastic parts, use denatured alcohol. Dampen a clean cloth with the alcohol, wipe down the components thoroughly, and let them air dry.\\n\\nNo matter which product you use, follow all listed safety precautions and work in a ventilated area.\", \"Use a vacuum with powerful suction and remove every bit of dirt and debris that you can from the fabric. For heavily-soiled seats, you may want to use a steam cleaner, then let them dry and follow up with the vacuum.\\nIf your fabric has a suede finish with a grain to it, brush the grain in its natural direction after vacuuming it and before painting it.\"], [\"Filler primers are formulated to smooth out small scratches and cracks in plastic parts. Depending on the product instructions, you may need to apply multiple layers of the primer to achieve the desired effect.\\n\\nFiller primers can be found with other spray primers and paints. Look for one specifically formulated for automotive uses, if possible.\\nNo filler primer can make deep scratches or cracks disappear, but they may become less noticeable.\\nFiller primers won't work on flexible materials like vinyl or fabric.\", \"This can be particularly useful for vinyl components, as it will help the spray paint adhere to the slick, flexible material. Look for it alongside other automotive primer sprays.\\n\\nYou can use this for plastic parts as well, if you don't need a filler primer.\\nDon't use a primer of any type on fabric before painting it.\", \"A sheltered spot with lots of airflow but minimal wind is ideal for spray priming and painting. Try a garage with all the doors and windows open, for instance. And always wear a breathing mask while spray painting to reduce your intake of fumes and particles.\\nAlso put down drop cloths, pieces of cardboard, or other protection against overspray.\", \"Follow the instructions on the can. Generally speaking, though, you'll shake the can for 1 minute; hold the can 6\\u20138 inches (15\\u201320\\u00a0cm) from the object; and spray in bursts over the surface of the object, keeping the can in motion as you spray.\\n\\nDon't hold the can in one spot, or you'll end up with splotches or bubbles on the surface.\\nApply 1, 2, or more coats as directed. For multiple coats, wait the recommended time between applications (usually 5-15 minutes).\"], [\"Plastic parts should be sprayed with a paint labeled for use on plastic. Vinyl or fabric parts should likewise be sprayed with a vinyl or fabric paint, respectively. If possible, choose spray paints designed for use on automotive components.\\nVinyl and fabric spray paints are able to flex along with those materials. A paint designed for plastic will crack and flake off of vinyl or fabric.\", \"Spraying on the paint involves the same process as applying primer. Shake the can as directed (usually for 1 minute), hold it 6\\u20138 inches (15\\u201320\\u00a0cm) from the object, and apply thin coats with bursts of spray while you move the can over the surface.\\n\\nWait approximately 10-15 minutes between coats\\u2014follow the package instructions.\\nIt may take 3-4 coats, or even more, to adequately cover some components. Applying numerous thin coats produces far superior results to trying to spray on 1 or 2 thick coats.\\nNo matter how many coats of spray paint you apply to fabric, you may never achieve ideal results that cover every spot on the fabric. This is especially true for suede fabric.

Different kinds of paint do different jobs.Single-stage paints are those which can be used independently, without an extra base or finishing layer. A good comparison is to nail polish. You can apply as many or as few layers as you wish, with nothing else being required.\\nSingle-stage paints are recommended for basic colours such as red, blue, or yellow. They dry to a glossy finish and are easy to prepare, so are perfect for the novice painter. Note, however, that these are rarely used to coat an entire car.\", \"Two-stage or base coat/clear coat paints will involve at least two coats (one base, one clear). The base coat provides the colour, while the clear coat provides extra protection against scratches and the elements.\\nA two-stage method tends to yield a more metallic finish. If this, along with greater protection, appeals to you, then opt for a compound coat.\", \"Whatever you choose, try not to vary your paint types or brands, as this can create an uneven result. If you don't know which paint or method is best suited to your vehicle, consult your owner's manual or local car dealer to find out.\", \"When mixing paint, you need to know what additional materials are required, as well as any safety precautions to take into consideration.

For example, a standard mixing ratio for single-stage paints is an 8/1/1 mixture. That is to say, for every 8 parts paint add one part thinner and one part hardener.\\nIf you are using a paint mixing cup there will be fractions which correspond to this ratio. So, you might fill the cup with paint to the '8' level, use thinner to reach '9,' and top it up to '10' with hardener.\", \"Paint sticks can be acquired from any trade store, otherwise a sturdy piece of wood or old tool will suffice to stir the mixture.

Cover the weather stripping, tail lights, and headlights as well to make sure these areas are protected.\", \"Most chemical strippers come in spray cans. However, you may instead want to use a brush to apply the stripper in a more controlled fashion. Apply enough chemical stripper to create a thin layer on the surface of the car. For best results, apply the chemical stripper from top to bottom, so that it flows downward and away from the car. If you\\u2019re using a brush to apply the stripper, rub the stripper in even vertical strokes, going from top to bottom.\", \"First, use a putty knife or paint scraper to scrape away the paint from the surface of the car. Scrape in a downward direction, applying generous pressure to ensure the paint is removed. Then, use a wet rag or sponge to wipe the area down and remove the rest of the paint. By the time you wipe off the area with your rag or sponge, the remaining paint should easily fall away from the car.\", \"For best results, go ahead and wash the entire body of the car with soap and water. Once the car is completely dried, apply 3 coats of automotive primer to the stripped area with a spray gun, waiting 15 minutes in between each coat. Then, spray 2 coats of paint onto the area to match the rest of the car.

However, if you\\u2019re working on a smaller or more vulnerable part of the car, you may want to go with soda instead. For example, it\\u2019s better to soda-blast an area composed of fiberglass than it is to sand-blast such an area. If you\\u2019re working with sand or plastic, go with a size somewhere between size 40 and size 12 for best results.Tip: A small, handheld compressor works great for relatively small areas of a car. However, if you need to blast the whole chassis, you may need to rent a large tow-behind compressor and blaster or take your car in to a professional.\", \"Hold the compressor about 12 to 14 inches (30 to 36 cm) away from the surface of the car. Compress the trigger on the compressor to begin blasting the car. If this isn\\u2019t close enough to strip the paint, slowly move the nozzle closer to the car until paint begins to come off. Make deliberate horizontal movements, making sure to not linger too long over any single area. If you blast one particular area for too long, you may end up damaging the metal underneath the paint.\", \"Stop blasting the car as soon as the paint is removed in order to avoid damaging the metal underneath. If the surface is rough and jagged, sand it with 80- to 100-grit sandpaper to smooth it out.\", \"Use a spray gun to apply 3 coats of automotive primer to the blasted surface as soon as possible in order to prevent the formation of rust. Then, repaint the area with 2 coats of spray paint to match the surrounding parts of the car. Finally, use a chamois to apply a thin layer of car polish and sealant to the blasted area to protect it from the elements.
