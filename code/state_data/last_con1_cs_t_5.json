Remove the yew if possible. Treat the soil with a fumigant or heat it for six weeks by covering it with plastic.\\nIf you see yellow mushrooms near the yew, the plant may die very quickly from Armillaria root rot.

Otherwise, he may be confused and a little hurt. Refrain from telling him something to the tune of \\\"Sounds okay\\\" or \\\"I'll go for it.\\\" Both phrases convey reluctance which could give him a sense of insecurity about himself and nervousness. Instead, try for a phrase similar to \\\"Yes, I would love to!\\\"\\n\\nHere are examples of other responses that convey enthusiasm and certainty: \\\"That sounds great,\\\" \\\"Of course, I would love to,\\\" \\\"Yes, I'm so flattered you would ask,\\\" and \\\"That would be lovely.\\\" These are simple, more mature answers, but prove to a boy you are more adult and mature.\\n\\nHere are some responses that would be appropriate for a text message proposal: \\\"Perfect, See U Then\\u00a0;),\\\" \\\"Yes!\\\" and \\\"I thought you'd never ask :D\\\"\\nDon't feel like you need the perfect, well-thought out response. A perfect response can just be a sincere smile followed by an enthusiastic \\\"Yes!\\\"\", \"This step is especially ideal if you know beforehand that he's going to ask you out. Imagine him in your mind asking you out as vividly as possible so you can work through any fear you have beforehand. Carefully select the words you want to use in your response and say them out loud until you feel confident enough.\", \"Words are only half the battle when saying yes. If you are truly excited about his offer then your body should reflect that excitement. There are a few easy ways to convey enthusiasm throughout your body.\\n\\nKeep an open posture. Don't cross your arms or your legs if you can avoid it. Stand with your arms open and your legs shoulder-width apart. A closed posture can convey fear, hesitation, and anxiety. \\n\\nMaintain eye contact and smile. You may become embarrassed or afraid, causing you to avert yours eyes away from him. Fight against your shyness and stare straight into his eyes while maintaining a bright, genuine smile so he knows you are as interested as he is. \\n\\nDon't be afraid of affection. If your reaction after saying yes is to give him a huge hug - then do it! Appropriate levels of physical affection, like a hug or a peck on the cheek, are an easy to show your enthusiasm.\", \"Being able to smoothly talk to romantic interests requires a strong sense of self-worth and belief in your own abilities. However, confidence doesn't happen overnight and you have to build it with a series of daily rituals and routines.\\n\\nMake a habit of saying nice things to yourself. Focus on your strengths and constantly remind yourself of your best traits. For example, you might look at yourself in the mirror every once in awhile and say, \\\"I'm a caring, compassionate person and I deserve to feel confident.\\\"\\nTalk to your friends and family about your insecurities. It's easy for negativity and self-doubt to build when you can't vent to anyone. Let your loved ones know when you're feeling down so they can remind you of your strengths and reaffirm how many people care about you.\\nTake time for yourself. Make sure you have time to immerse yourself in the things you enjoy. Paint, practice music, read, or engage with whatever your hobbies are so you can keep yourself upbeat and interested. Happy people are confident people.\", \"Inevitably you may trip up your words while responding to him, and that's completely fine. In fact, he may find your nervousness endearing. You don't need to be perfect, just keep talking to him and give him some form of a yes.\", \"You may have said \\\"No\\\" out of nervousness, shyness, or confusion. In this situation, your best course of action would be to talk to him as soon as you can and clear up your feelings. Explain the situation in a simple, calm fashion. For example, you might say, \\\"Wow, I can't believe how taken aback I was at your question the other day. I meant to say yes but I was so shocked that I blurted out no without thinking about it. I would love to go out with you!\\\"\", \"\\\"Will you go out with me?\\\" is a vague question, and after or even before saying \\\"Yes\\\" you should make sure exactly what he's asking. Does he want to start a relationship? Is he interested in dating casually? Does he just want to go out to a movie? Understand his endgame so the two of you don't have different ideas about your future plans.\"], [\"Does he have a good personality that you are attracted to? Are you genuinely attracted to him or are you just flattered that someone would ask you out? Would you really consider starting a serious relationship with him?\\n\\nIf you answered yes to most of these questions, maybe he is someone you'd want to get into a relationship with. However, it's best that you get to know him better if you don't already know him well enough to go out with him.\\nIf you answered no to most of these questions, perhaps you should reconsider your answer to him. You could decline or you could take the chance and go out with him, but remember to make sure you choose an answer that makes you happy and that you won't regret later.\\nDon't be afraid to take your time when deciding. Entering a relationship with someone is a decision that should be taken seriously. Remember that other partners will be available in the future so don't feel pressured to accept an offer from a person who you don't truly desire.\", \"Write down the traits you want your ideal partner to have. Consider things like religious beliefs, hobbies, career goals, ethics, physical features, sexual preferences, and lifestyle choices. Order them from most important to least important so you can determine which features you would be willing to compromise on. Next, try and discern how many of these features are mirrored in the guy who asked you out.\", \"Think about whether you want to go out with him because you genuinely enjoy his company, or because you're trying to cover up insecurities. By accepting his invitation, you've started something with him, and you cannot end it after one day with him. Remember that boys are not toys - they have their own feelings as well, and you should respect that.\", \"This can be a good option if you're too taken aback or uncertain to respond immediately. If the guy cannot respect that, maybe you shouldn't consider dating him at all. However, if he truly cares about you and he respects your request then it's a good sign that he's worth your time.\"], [\"After saying yes, it's crucial to keep the momentum alive. A good way to do this is setting up another date after he initially asked you out. Maybe even switch roles and ask him out this time.\", \"For example, send a follow-up text after he asked you out saying how excited you are for the date. Or, you could just open more lines for casual conversation. Start asking him about his day, or open up and tell him some of the random thoughts on your mind that you might not communicate with anyone else.\", \"Unfortunately, a relationship may go awry even if you accepted his proposal in the best possible way. There can be number of early warning signs that can tell you whether the relationship, even if it's just casual dating, is worth it.\\n\\nLook out for possessiveness. If you're only a few weeks into the relationship and he's trying to know your whereabouts 24/7, then something's not right. Make sure you have enough time for your own independence in the relationship. \\n\\nSee if he's caught up on another lover. Some people rush into relationships in order to compensate for harsh breakups. Press gently on his past loves to gauge how he feels about them. Open up about your past relationships as well to make him feel more comfortable.\\nHeed advice from friends. Be sure to take him around your friends and family to get a feel for how he reacts around them.

You greatly increase your chances of getting someone to say yes if you perfect your delivery. Speak confidently and deliberately, without saying \\u201cum\\u201d or \\u201cuh\\u201d or tripping over your words.\\n\\nRemember that practice makes perfect. Before you deliver your question, rehearse what you\\u2019re planning to say. You don\\u2019t have to rehearse down to memorization because you don\\u2019t want to sound robotic. Simply practice asking what you plan to ask for until you feel like you sound confident and prepared. If you\\u2019re a more visual learner, it might be beneficial for you to jot down exactly what you want to say and rehearse that way.\\n\\nPracticing in front of a mirror is especially helpful because it helps you also take note of nonverbal issues you might have, like playing with your hair or avoiding eye contact.\", \"Studies have shown that nodding your head while you pitch an idea helps you feel more positive and confident, which translates to you appearing more confident and knowledgeable to your audience, whether it\\u2019s a boss, client, or loved one.\\nWhile this nonverbal cue is an important one to use, it\\u2019s equally important to not overdo it. Only nod as it feels natural to you. Don\\u2019t force it or it can end up serving as a distraction from your words rather than a helpful supplement to them.\", \"People are more likely to say yes to you if you can prove how whatever you\\u2019re proposing might help or benefit them in some way. Show them what\\u2019s in it for them if you agree to your question.\\n\\nFor example, if you want to take some time off from work, then you might speak with your boss about what times of the year are generally slowest at your work and go from there. This way, your boss sees the benefit to granting you your vacation: you\\u2019re being thoughtful and taking it during a slow time of year, so it won\\u2019t hurt the company\\u2019s bottom line.\\nOr, if you want to take your spouse out on a date and need to convince your teenager to babysit their younger siblings, you might ask them to babysit in exchange for a later curfew, money, or use of your car on the weekend, for instance. This demonstrates to your teen that saying yes to you will be mutually beneficial.\", \"You cannot sell someone on your idea or proposal if you haven\\u2019t done your homework, either beforehand or during your present conversation. If someone isn\\u2019t interested in what you\\u2019re suggesting or offering, then no amount of persuasion will get them to say yes.\\nIf a family of five walks into a car dealership and you start trying to sell them on a two-seater sports car, then you\\u2019re wasting your time. Ask questions like \\u201cWhat will you be using the vehicle for primarily?\\u201d and \\u201cWhat features are you looking for in a vehicle?\\u201d Hone in on what they need, and they will be more likely to say yes and allow you to complete a sale.\", \"This is also known as the \\u201cfoot-in-the-door\\u201d method, and it refers to asking for something small as a lead-in to a larger request, with the reasoning being that people are more likely to say yes to a larger proposal if they\\u2019ve already said yes to something smaller. For example, if you talk your child into taking at least one bite of their dinner, then once the one bite is agreed to, then it is more likely that they\\u2019ll continue eating if you ask. (Especially if there\\u2019s a reward for continuing!)\", \"Nothing ruins negotiations like a sour mood. If at all possible, don\\u2019t attempt to negotiate with someone who is angry or standoffish. Wait until the person is in a better mood to mention your request. Over a meal, whether at home or during an evening out, is usually a good time to bring up a request.\\n\\nOf course, this doesn\\u2019t apply to work situations where you are required to negotiate, such as selling an unhappy customer on something. Situating your request in a positive environment can\\u2019t always happen. However, if it is within your control to choose, then do wait till the person you\\u2019re seeking a yes from is in a good mood. This increases your chances of hearing a yes.\\nTell tale nonverbal signs that you should wait if possible include crossed arms, external distractions (like a phone call or misbehaving kids), or eye rolls or scowls. Even if you\\u2019re being engaged by the person out of politeness, you\\u2019re not truly going to be heard, so you are better off waiting and approaching them at a better time when they\\u2019re less distracted or upset.\"], [\"People tend to base their decisions on the opinions of others. We read restaurant reviews before we dine out, and we read movie reviews and ask our friends\\u2019 opinions before we see a movie. This same \\u201cherd mentality\\u201d can be a helpful tool in getting someone to say yes to you.\\n\\nIf you\\u2019re attempting to sell a house, for example, using this technique would entail printing out ratings of the neighborhood available online, showing prospective buyers how elite the property is, and showing that the area has some of the city\\u2019s best schools, for example. This peer pressure through others\\u2019 positive reviews might seal the deal for you on the home sale.\\nSimilarly, if you\\u2019re trying to convince your parents to let you study abroad, for example, letting them know how exclusive the program is or how favorably other students and parents (and future employers!) have viewed the experience might persuade them to allow you to go.\", \"If you ask people for a favor without demonstrating a clear benefit to them, they might not be inclined to help you. However, if you give a reason, then they are more likely to say yes to you. It\\u2019s important to make sure that your reason is truthful and valid. Otherwise, if they determine that you\\u2019re lying, now you appear dishonest and they will be even less likely to agree to your request.\\nFor example, if you are waiting in a long line for the restroom and you can\\u2019t wait, you can try going to the person at the front and asking to cut in line. If you simply ask \\u201cI have to use the restroom. May I cut in line?\\u201d they are far less likely to agree than if you instead ask the same question with a reason given. Saying something like \\u201cMay I cut in line? I have to use the restroom urgently because I have a digestive disorder\\u201d is far more likely to get someone to agree to your request.\", \"\\u201d This psychological concept is based on that notion that once someone does something for us, we then feel obligated to reciprocate by doing something for them. For instance, if we covered a shift for a co-worker when they were sick, then the next time you need a shift covered, you might ask that co-worker to work for you and mention that you covered for them before.\\nTo do this you might try saying something like, \\u201cI need this Friday off, and since I covered for you last weekend, I was hoping you might be able to work for me this week.\\u201d This prior indebtedness makes it more likely that they will say yes to working for you.\", \"Advertisers employ this technique all the time by declaring their deal to be a \\u201climited time offer\\u201d or available \\u201conly while quantities last.\\u201d You can use this trick to get people to say yes to you. If you\\u2019re selling someone something and you mention that it\\u2019s available only for a limited time or in limited release, then it\\u2019s more likely that people will agree to buy the product you\\u2019re pitching.\"], [\"Studies have shown that people become overwhelmed and discouraged when they are presented with too many options. If possible, try to limit your proposal to just a couple options to avoid this happening.\\nSome examples of this might be giving only two choices of restaurants to your significant other or asking which dress of two pre-selected ones your friend likes best on you. This narrows the field from the broad, harder questions of \\u201cWhere should we eat tonight?\\u201d or \\u201cWhat should I wear?\\u201d Giving specific, limited options to choose from gives this a choice of two \\u201cyes\\u2019s\\u201d and ensures that they can easily make a decision.\", \"Not all battles can be won without compromise. If you are trying to persuade someone to say yes to you and they are willing to negotiate or say yes conditionally, then that is a step in the right direction. Consider it a win that you convinced them to meet you halfway or more.\\n\\nThis is especially applicable in situations where you\\u2019re dealing with a superior, like a parent or a boss. For example, if you\\u2019re trying to reason with your parents about your curfew, then there might be some room for negotiation. If they want you home by 11pm and you want to stay out till 1am, then it is a victory if they agree to midnight as a compromise. Or, if you approach your boss about receiving a 7% raise, and they agree to 4%, then count that as a win because you still persuaded them that you deserved more money. You\\u2019ve gotten what you were looking for (more time out with your friends or a pay increase) in a roundabout way.\\nDon\\u2019t look at compromises as negatives. Instead look at them as receiving a yes with conditions. Your power of persuasion put you in a far better situation than you were in before you tried to convince them that you needed what you asked for.\", \"Sometimes it\\u2019s helpful to ask questions that you know will lead to positive responses. Rather than trying to convince someone of something or sell something, occasionally we want positive responses to create a light mood or relaxed atmosphere. On a first date or at a family gathering, for example, when you have a vested interest in making sure everyone is agreeable, this can be a helpful strategy to employ.\\nFor example, if you\\u2019re out on a date you might say something like, \\u201cWasn\\u2019t that wine fantastic?\\u201d or \\u201cDon\\u2019t you love this city?\\u201d Or, at a family dinner, for instance, you might say something like, \\u201cIsn\\u2019t grandma\\u2019s turkey the best?\\u201d These kinds of questions almost insist on a yes and help you find common ground with the people around you.\", \"Even if you didn\\u2019t fully get the person to say yes, you should attempt to end your meeting or conversation proactively, with a look to the future. This gets you out of limbo and into a forward progression toward your goal.\\nFor example, if you tried to sell some furniture to a man who says he needs to talk it over with his wife, then you might end your conversation by saying something like \\u201cSounds great. Would Thursday be a good day to follow up with the both of you?\\u201d Salespeople and others who work on deals for a living adhere to the adage of \\u201calways be closing.\\u201d Proactively working toward your next meeting is a great way to not take no for an answer without seeming pushy or causing the other person to shut down completely.\"]], \"methodsHeadlines\": [[\"Speak with confidence and

For example, you could say it to a friend or younger person, but not to a stranger or your boss.\", \"The word \\u3046\\u3093, pronounced \\\"oo-n\\\", is a more colloquial way of saying yes, and is fairly similar to saying \\\"yep\\\" or \\\"yeah\\\" in English. Because of how casual it is, \\u3046\\u3093 is more for use when chatting casually with friends; it should not be used when talking to a stranger or a higher-up, like a teacher.\\nDon't confuse \\u3046\\u3093 with \\u3046\\u3046\\u3093 - \\u3046\\u3093 means \\\"yes\\\", whereas \\u3046\\u3046\\u3093 (oo-oon) means \\\"no\\\"!\", \"Pronounced as \\\"soh dess\\\", \\u305d\\u3046\\u3067\\u3059 is often used as \\\"yes, that's so\\\" or \\\"that's correct\\\" in response to questions.

However, if someone were to ask \\\"What's your password?\\\" in Japanese, they would know you meant why, and you weren't disagreeing to the question.\\nIn Japanese, adding \\\"Ka\\\" to the end of a sentence makes it a question, not a statement.

This will prevent your milk from burning, and you should only have to stir it occasionally. If you cannot do this, and must heat the milk directly, be sure to monitor it constantly, stirring all of the while. If you do not have a thermometer, 185\\u00baF (85\\u00baC) is the temperature at which milk starts to froth. It is highly recommended that you obtain a thermometer in the range of 100 - 212\\u00baF, especially if you plan to make yogurt on an ongoing basis.\\nYou can use any kind of milk, including whole milk, 2 percent, 1 percent, nonfat, pasteurized, homogenized, organic, raw, diluted evaporated, dry powdered, cow, goat, soybean, and more. UHP, or ultra-high pasteurized milk, is processed to a higher temperature, which breaks down some of the proteins that the bacteria need to make the milk into yogurt. Some have reported difficulties in making yogurt from UHP.\", \"The best way to do this is with a cold water bath. This will quickly and evenly lower the temperature, and requires only occasional stirring. If cooling at room temperature, or in the refrigerator, you must stir it more frequently. Don't proceed until the milk is below 120\\u00baF (49\\u00baC), and don't allow it to go below 90\\u00baF (32\\u00baC); 110\\u00baF (43\\u00baC) is optimal.\", \"The starter is the bacteria that you add to the milk, which in turn cultivates more bacteria--bacteria that is necessary for the creation of yogurt. Let the starter yogurt sit at room temperature while you're waiting for the milk to cool. This will prevent it from being too cold when you add it in.\\n\\nAll yogurt needs \\\"good\\\" bacteria. The easiest way to add this is to use existing yogurt. The first time you make your own yogurt, use store-bought plain (unflavored) yogurt. Be certain it has \\\"active cultures\\\" on the label. Yogurt cultures die over time so try and find the freshest yogurt that has a tart flavor, but no added flavors or other additives. Taste various plain yogurts before you get started. You will find that different kinds taste a bit different. Use one you like for your own starter. The different flavors are due to other bacteria than the two main bacteria needed to create yogurt.\\nAlternatively, instead of using existing yogurt, use freeze-dried bacteria cultures (available in specialty stores or online), which are more reliable as a starter.\\nIn a pinch, you can use a flavored yogurt, but the taste of the resulting cultured yogurt will not be exactly the same as using plain yogurt.\", \"Adding about 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup dry milk at this time will increase the nutritional content of the yogurt. The yogurt will also thicken more easily. This is especially helpful if you're using nonfat milk.\", \"Add 2 tablespoons of the existing yogurt, or add the freeze-dried bacteria. Stir with a whisk or use a blender (such as a stick blender) to evenly distribute the bacteria throughout the milk. If you still have stringy ropes you may be heating your milk too fast or too long (scalding). Use a double boiler in that case, or at least stir regularly and check temperature with a thermometer. At high altitudes this can be more of a problem.\"], [\"Pour the milk into a clean container or containers. Cover each one tightly with a lid or plastic wrap.\\nYou could also use Ball jars if you are so inclined, but these are not necessary.\", \"Keep the yogurt warm and still to encourage bacterial growth, while keeping the temperature as close to 100\\u00baF (38\\u00baC) as possible. The longer the mixture incubates, the thicker and more tangy the yogurt will be.\\n\\nKeep the yogurt still during incubation. Jiggling won't ruin it, but it makes it take a lot longer to incubate.\\nAfter seven hours, you'll have a custard-like texture, a cheesy odor, and possibly some greenish liquid on top. This is exactly what you want. The longer you let it sit beyond seven hours, the thicker and tangier it will become.\", \"Use a thermometer to make sure the temperature stays consistent. Choose the method that is most convenient and consistent for you. The most common way is to use a yogurt maker. The proper way to use a yogurt maker is detailed in the following steps.\\n\\nYou could also use the pilot light in your oven, or preheat the oven to the desired temperature, turn it off, and then leave the oven light on to maintain the temperature.Turn your oven on periodically, as needed to maintain the temperature. This method is tricky; make sure that it doesn't get too hot. Or, you could use the bread proof setting if your oven has one.\\nOther methods include using a food dehydrator, a rice cooker's warm setting, a heating pad set to low, or a crock pot set on its lowest setting.\\nIf you have none of these things, you could use a sunny window or a car in the sun. Note that light exposure may degrade the nutrition in the milk. It is best to maintained the temperature  below 120\\u00baF (49\\u00baC), don't allow it to go below 90\\u00baF (32\\u00baC); blood temp to 110\\u00baF (43\\u00baC) is optimal. Additionally, you could place the container of yogurt in warm water in a sink, large bowl, or small picnic cooler.\", \"There are several categories of retail yogurt makers available today, if you decide to use a yogurt maker (which is recommended.) Yogurt makers allow for the safest and timeliest incubation of the yogurt bacteria.\\n\\nThe untimed, resistance heated yogurt makers are generally popular because of their low cost. They tend to be less expensive because they are designed with no control over the temperatures needed to properly incubate the yogurt bacterial culture(s) in the dairy product used.  They are designed for average home temperatures but higher or lower environmental temperatures can change the time it takes to make the yogurt and quality of the yogurt produced. They generally come with smaller cups and must be used repeatedly throughout each week to provide for daily consumption of yogurt. With larger families, they can become impractical because of the time it takes to make a given quantity of yogurt.\\nThe temperature regulating yogurt makers are more expensive as they require more electronic components to be able to maintain temperature settings. There are two types within this category:\\nAnother type has an (optimal) factory temperature setting which is maintained regardless of environment. You cannot adjust the temperature setting in this type.\\nThere are yogurt makers which combine some of the features found in some of the above categories. For example, one yogurt maker provides a factory set regulated temperature with a time - display and cut-off feature. This unit is capable of producing a quality yogurt result in as little as 2 hours as the temperature setting is well above popular home yogurt culturing temperatures. It allows the user to use more than cup-sized containers, although they are supplied in several sizes with the yogurt maker. You can use a gallon size container or 4 wide-mouth quart containers to make as much as a gallon at a time. However, with the taller jars, either a larger cover may be needed or towels may be used to cover the gap between the supplied cover and bottom (heating and control) unit.\", \"The user can adjust the temperature setting of the yogurt maker to maintain the proper temperatures associated with the bacterial strain(s) used in the culturing of the yogurt.  Once set, they will maintain the setting, regardless of how warm or cold your home or kitchen may be.\\nYogurt makers which allow the user to set the amount of time the yogurt maker applies heat to the containers.  While this time setting may be handy should you need to leave the yogurt maker unattended, it is suggested the user remain in the general area (home) so that if anything should go wrong (like the unit failing to shut off) - granted a rare occurrence - may deal with the situation.\", \"Make sure they are evenly spaced out and standing up straight (you wouldn't want them to tip over or the yogurt could leak out.)\", \"That maintains the containers at a temperature which, hopefully, allows the bacteria in the tempered dairy product in the containers go grow and thrive to make yogurt.\", \"In due time - depending on bacterial strain(s) used, temperature and food available in the dairy product - the dairy product will firm up to a yogurt consistency.  This can take as little as 2 hours and can last 12 hours or longer. The shorter times usually result in less tart yogurts and longer times provide completion of the bacterial growth.  For those lactose intolerant folks, the longer times may produce a more digestible yogurt.\", \"Once the yogurt has gotten to the consistency and time desired, the containers are removed from the yogurt maker and placed in a refrigerator to cool for storage until consumption. The containers, which may be supplied with the yogurt maker, can be small cups so that the user can eat the yogurt right out of the cups. Containers as large as a gallon or more can be held by some yogurt makers for those who need large amounts of yogurt on a regular basis.\", \"Try gently jiggling one of the containers - the yogurt will not move if it is ready and you can take it from the yogurt maker and put it in the refrigerator then. Or you can wait and let it get more tart for 12 hours or more.\"], [\"Put the cheesecloth in a colander and put the colander in a large bowl to catch the whey, which is a thin yellow liquid. Put the yogurt in the colander, cover the colander with a plate, and put it all in the refrigerator.  Strain for a couple of hours for greek yogurt.  Strain overnight for a very thick yogurt, almost like soft cream cheese.\", \"Place the yogurt in your fridge for several hours before serving. It will keep for 1 to 2 weeks. If you're going to use some of it as starter, use it within 5 to 7 days, so that the bacteria still have growing power. Whey will form on the top. You can pour it off or stir it in before eating your yogurt.\\nMany commercial yogurts include a thickening agent, such as pectin, starch, gum, or gelatin. Don't be surprised or concerned if your homemade yogurt has a somewhat thinner consistency without these thickeners. Putting the yogurt in the freezer to cool it before to moving it to the refrigerator will result in a smoother consistency. You can also stir or shake in the lumps.\", \"Experiment until you develop a flavor that your taste buds fancy. Canned pie filling, jams, maple syrup, and ice-cream fudges are good flavorings.

Try doing the following to keep your restaurant meals sugar-free:\\n\\nGet your salads dressed with plain oil and vinegar, rather than choosing a pre-made salad dressing.  Also, always ask for dressings to be served on the side.\\nAsk for main dishes to be made without sauces and gravies that might have added sugar.

White bread, bagels, muffins, and rice tend to have high glycemic indexes.\", \"Breakfast cereals are a hidden source of sugar in many people\\u2019s diets. Depending on the type, some cereals have over 15 g of added sugars, along with enriched flours. This could add a lot of sugar to your diet, so use caution when you get cereal. Read all the labels and get cereals with low sugar.\\nIf you don\\u2019t like the taste of low-sugar cereal, try adding fruit or cinnamon for more flavor.\", \"Condiments are another sneaky way that you might be adding a lot of sugar to your diet. Ketchup, barbeque sauce, salad dressings, teriyaki sauce, and some tomato sauces are loaded with sugar for flavoring. Check the labels on all the condiments you buy and eliminate ones with high sugar contents.\\n\\nYou can still use some of these condiments, but limit the serving size. Measure out a spoonful to control the amount you have.\\nSome low-sugar condiments are mustard, mayonnaise, sauerkraut, and relish.

Once you break your habit, food and drinks that are less sweet will taste just fine to you.\\nAs you get used to less-sweet foods and drinks, you can reduce your sugar usage even more until you gradually cut it out entirely.\", \"When you swear-off sugar, treat it as an opportunity to explore other flavors. You might not know what you were missing while you were adding sugar to everything!

These are sugar-free, but don\\u2019t have a good effect on weight-loss or other health goals.\", \"Fruit is naturally-sweet and can sweeten your food and drinks without any added sugar. Chop up some of your favorite fruits and add them to your oatmeal, drinks, pancakes, and baked items to get a sweet flavor without sugar.\\n\\nTry infusing your water or seltzers with chopped fruit like lemon, grapes, and raspberries. This adds flavor and nutrition to plain drinks.\\nDried fruits like raisins and cranberries are good ways to sweeten your oatmeal or cereal. Be sure to check and make sure they aren\\u2019t coated in any sugar, though.\", \"By baking your own desserts, you can control the amount of sugar you in them. You could even replace sugar altogether with different ingredients. This is a great way to continue enjoying desserts without overdoing it with sugar.\\n\\nCinnamon and nutmeg are good non-sugar ingredients to bake with.\\nMany people replace sugar with apple sauce in baking recipes. This is a much healthier alternative.\"], [\"If sugary foods are in your home, then you\\u2019ll probably be tempted to eat them. It\\u2019s best to get rid of all the desserts and sugary foods you own and stop buying more altogether. With that temptation removed, you can handle your cravings without giving in.\\n\\nIf you live with others, try to get them to support you by not leaving sugary foods lying around. They could hide them somewhere and not eat them while you\\u2019re around.\\nIf you do need some desserts for company or a holiday, try to get it the day of the event so you\\u2019re not tempted to eat it before.\", \"Protein keeps your blood sugar stabilized, which can prevent cravings as you wean yourself off sugar. It also helps keep you full, so you\\u2019ll have fewer hunger cravings as well. Include a source of protein in every meal to keep your body nourished and free from sugar cravings.\\n\\nGood protein sources are chicken and poultry, fish, beans, nuts and seeds, peanut or almond butter, eggs, and dairy products.\\nTry to avoid protein sources with a lot of saturated fats, like red meat. These are bad for your cardiovascular health.\\nNuts and seeds are a great source of protein and handy to carry around. Try packing some in your bag for a quick snack if you feel a craving during the day.\", \"Similar to protein, fats slow the release of sugar in your body and keep your blood sugar regulated. Polyunsaturated fats, also called healthy or good fats, are the best type because your body breaks them down slowly for a sustained energy release.\\n\\nGood fat sources are avocados, oily fish like salmon, nuts, and olive oil.\\nAvoid saturated fats from processed or fried foods and red meats.\", \"Skipping meals, especially breakfast, causes a blood sugar drop. Besides hunger and fatigue, this causes increased sugar cravings. Eating balanced meals at regular times is one of the best ways to avoid these cravings.\\nIf you regularly get hungry during the day, pack some healthy snacks like nuts to have on the go.\", \"Studies show that exercise helps reduce cravings of all kinds, including cravings for sugar. Stay active to handle your own sugar cravings. Try to get 30 minutes of exercise at least 5 days per week for the best results.\\n\\nAerobic or weight-bearing exercises have similar effects. As long as you\\u2019re staying active, you should see some positive benefits.\\nIf you\\u2019re swearing off sugar to lose weight, then getting regular exercise will help you reach that goal.\", \"Stress-eating is common, and people usually pick unhealthy, sugary foods for their stress-eating.

If you really want to cut sugar cravings, you can try taking a more severe approach, at least for the initial 10 days.

Keeping this in mind, buy as many stems as you need to produce the size crop you want.\", \"Leave three to four joints per piece, to make it more likely that each piece will produce a few sprouts. If the stems have any leaves or flowers, go ahead and remove them.\", \"Sugar cane stems are planted horizontally on their sides, in four-inch deep furrows, or trenches.

Brown sugar or raw sugar will also work, but be prepared for a less predictable flavor due to the higher molasses content.\", \"Pour the sugar into a zip locked bag, a Tupperware container, a jar, or any other clean, airtight container. Because this method uses dry, powdered spices, there will be no need for a blender or other tool.\\nYou can easily make a larger or smaller batch with these same instructions. Just remember to multiply the amount of spice used as well.\", \"For this method, use a dry, ground or powdered spice (or grind the spice in a spice grinder or mortar). Different spices have different strengths, so feel free to experiment. The range given is a good starting point, from 2 tsp (10 mL) for a touch of flavor, up to 10 tsp (50 mL) for a strong flavor.\\n\\n\\n are all commonly used in desserts, making them an obvious option to pair with sugar. These work well alone or in any combination with each other.\\n\\n sugar is a flavor for the fearless, adding a bold garnish to a plate or cocktail.\\n\\n or other flavorful powders can also be added using this method. Try using 1/4 cup (60 mL) instead, since these tend to have a less concentrated flavor than spices.\", \"Close the airtight container and mix the sugar and spices together by shaking. Alternatively, mix with a fork or other utensil, but make sure the ingredients are evenly distributed before closing the container.\", \"The sugar will take time to absorb the surrounding flavors, becoming more potent over the course of the next few days. Since all the ingredients used in this method are dry, you may store this sugar in an ordinary shaker or sugar bowl.\"], [\"Any leafy herb or citrus zest can be added using this method. Here are a few ideas, along with estimated amounts to use for every 1 cup (240 mL) sugar:\\n\\n\\n are all aromatic flavors. Lavender will produce an especially strong scent. Set aside about 3 tablespoons (45 mL) per cup (240 mL) sugar.\\n\\n\\n makes a sugar that works well in baking and cocktails. Try using 1/2 cup (120 mL) of loosely packed mint leaves.\\n\\n\\n is a more unusual flavor for sweets, and may pair well with lime. Use about 1.5 tbsp (22 mL).\\n\\n\\n, or any other citrus fruit can be zest and added to sugar. Zest the fruit's colored outer rind, avoiding the white pith. Use the zest from two fruits for a moderate flavor, or several more for a stronger one.\", \"Fresh leaves and citrus rind should be dried before adding, to avoid clumping the sugar with moisture. There are several ways to accomplish this:\\n\\nLay them out on a layer of paper towels, without overlaps, and microwave in 30-second bursts. Check between each burst, and remove when the herbs are crisp.\\n\\nTurn an oven to the lowest setting, lay the herbs on a baking sheet, and warm for about 20 minutes, or until dry. Using an oven at a higher setting is not recommended, due to the risk of burning the herbs.\\n\\nLeave the herbs in a location with a light breeze, to dry for 8\\u201424 hours. Direct sunlight may reduce the flavor.\", \"Sugar will infuse much more quickly if the other ingredients are ground in a spice grinder or coffee grinder. This will also produce a more evenly colored and textured end product.\\n\\nA food processor might work, but it may not turn the ingredients fully into powder.\\n\\nIf using dried lavender, you may prefer to leave the flowers in the sugar whole, and strain them out before using the sugar. The lavender flowers (or scoops of the lavender sugar) can then be used to infuse a couple more batches of sugar before they lose their potency.\", \"White granulated sugar is less likely to clump than most other sugars, making it a good choice for these moisture-containing ingredients. Feel free to experiment with other options if you prefer.\", \"The sugar should infuse overnight, and continue to taste stronger over the course of the next few days. Store in a dry, airtight container to protect the sugar from humidity and microorganisms.\\nUse citrus zest sugar within two weeks.\"], [\"Almond extract, vanilla extract, and fruit extracts are simple ways to flavor sugar. Start by adding just two to four drops of extract per cup (240 mL) of sugar, since these flavors are concentrated. Stir thoroughly until the color is even, using a spoon to mash apart clumps of moist sugar.\", \"Slice a vanilla bean pod lengthwise and scoop out as much of the sticky, inner seed material as you can. Stir or blend this sticky material thoroughly with 2\\u20134 cups (480\\u2013960 mL) sugar, depending on how strong a flavor you desire. Add the bean pod itself to the sugar and store in an airtight container. Wait at least 48 hours before using, while the flavor infuses.\", \"You'd never thought of alcoholic sugar before, but now you're interested. Cocktail bitters usually have a strong flavor, so start with two or three teaspoons (10\\u201315 mL) per cup (240 mL) of sugar, and add more if necessary.\", \"Freeze-dried fruit can be ground in a spice grinder or coffee grinder, then mixed into sugar by hand. This will also add color to the sugar bowl more than most other flavors.\"], [\"Stir vanilla sugar or cocoa sugar into hot milk. Use mint or citrus sugar in iced tea or mojitos. Almost any flavored sugar can be used as cocktail garnish. Rub the rim of the glass with a lemon wedge, then sprinkle the sugar crystals over it.\", \"Many spices and extracts used to flavor sugar are already used in desserts. Replace the ordinary sugar in a baking recipe, or make the flavor more obvious by topping muffins, rice pudding, or parfait. Use citrus sugar instead for a complementary sour tinge.\", \"Granulated sugar can be formed into sugar cubes by adding about 1 tsp (5 mL) water for every 1/2 cup (120 mL) sugar. Add more water or sugar as necessary in tiny amounts, stirring thoroughly, until the sugar is slightly moist and crumbly. Press this into a miniature ice cube tray for a typical sugar cube, or into any silicone mold for more unusual shapes. Leave out at room temperature until hard (one to eight hours), then transfer to an airtight container.\\n\\nIf you don't have molds, you can press the wet sugar flat on a wax paper-lined baking pan. Cut it into a grid pattern (or into any shapes), then let dry.\\nYou can combine this step with the flavoring by substituting half the water with extract or cocktail bitters.\", \"Tie a string to a pencil, placed over a clean, glass jar.

Superfine sugar reduces the risk of crystallization. A raw brown sugar such as turbinado or demerara creates a brown, molasses-flavored syrup good for rum or bourbon cocktails.\\nDo not use confectioner's sugar (powdered sugar). This usually contains cornstarch, which does not dissolve in water. The syrup will be cloudy or grainy.\", \"Measure the sugar and water and combine in a saucepan. Use an equal amount of both ingredients for a basic syrup. For a more concentrated syrup, use up to twice as much sugar as water.\\n\\nA more concentrated syrup has a higher risk of crystallizing back into solids, but will last longer in the fridge. Some bartenders prefer a concentrated syrup because it can sweeten a cocktail without adding too much water.\\nFor greater accuracy, measure ingredients by weight on a kitchen scale. Using volume measurements (cups or milliliters) won't cause major issue, but you'll end up with about \\u215e the amount of sugar.\", \"Turn on the heat under your sugar-water mixture. Stir until all the sugar crystals have dissolved. The sugar usually dissolves within a few minutes, but a large batch may take longer.\\n\\nDo not let the mixture boil. If you lose too much water, the sugar may not be able to dissolve.\\nFor very concentrated syrups (at least a 2:1 ratio of sugar to water), stir the last bits of water gently. Too much stirring when the maximum amount of sugar has dissolved can cause crystals to reform.\", \"A single grain of sugar left in the syrup can create a large mass of solid crystals. If you see any sugar left on the side of the pot, brush it down to the syrup using a wet pastry brush. Alternatively, just put the lid on the pot for a few minutes, and the condensed water should run down the sides and clean them.\\nBecause the lid traps most of the water vapor, it's all right if the syrup boils for a short time while the lid is on. To be safe, stick with a brief simmer.\", \"it will be ready to store once it reaches room temperature.\\nIf the sugar crystallizes when it cools, either too much water boiled away, or not all the sugar dissolved. Add a little water and heat it up again.\", \"Bring a small, separate pot of water to a boil. Once boiled, pour directly into a clean jar or bottle. Pour boiling water over the lid of the container as well. Sterilizing the container will reduce the chance that your syrup re-crystallizes, and prolong shelf life.\\nUnless using immediately, store in a clear container so you can watch for signs of mold.\", \"Dump the hot water out of the container, and immediately pour in the room temperature syrup. Fasten the lid and store in the refrigerator.\\n\\nA 1:1 syrup stays good for about one month.\\nA 2:1 syrup stays good for about six months.\\nTo keep your syrup useful for much longer, stir in a spoonful of high-proof vodka.\"], [\"Sugar will dissolve in room temperature water, if you shake it hard enough. Because there's no heat to sterilize the syrup, this version will only last about two weeks. As far as taste goes, bartenders have lined up on both sides of the hot-cold debate. Give it a whirl and decide for yourself: \\n\\nCombine equal parts sugar and water in a sealed container. (Using superfine sugar may shorten the shaking time.)\\n\\nShake for three minutes, then let rest for one minute.\\nShake for another 30 seconds, or until all sugar is dissolved.\", \"Simmer the syrup with herbs or spices for about 30\\u201345 minutes to extract flavors. Try cinnamon and nutmeg syrup for winter holiday desserts, or basil syrup for sophisticated cocktails.\\n\\nIf using herbs, remove them as soon as they turn brown. Strain out leaves once the syrup is done.\\nThe addition of other ingredients may shorten the shelf life. Stir a spoonful of vodka into the cooled syrup to prevent mold.\", \"Adding gum arabic to the syrup creates a silky texture, and lowers the chance of crystallization. This old-fashioned recipe is making a small comeback due to the appealing texture it lends to cocktails:\\n\\nBring water nearly to a boil. Slowly mix in an equal amount gum arabic, by weight. Stir until gluey and mostly combined.\\nLet sit for two to three hours, off the heat. Stir again to work in lumps.\\nStart making sugar syrup, as above. Use twice as much water as you did for the gum arabic.\\nOnce sugar is dissolved, reduce to a simmer. Stir in gum arabic mixture slowly, while stirring.\\nLet cool, then skim off and discard scum from the top of the syrup.\", \"Add this dark caramel flavor to whiskey cocktails or a bittersweet chocolate cake. Wear gloves and stand back from the pan, as molten sugar can cause severe burns. Try it out as follows:\\n\\nHeat the sugar (alone) in a stainless steel saucepan, stirring once every 30 seconds.\\nFor caramel syrup: Add water as soon as the sugar melts. This will cause spattering and steaming, so stand back as you pour. Stir rapidly and constantly until syrup forms.\\nFor burnt caramel syrup: Turn on stove ventilation or open windows \\u2014 there will likely be smoke. Wait until sugar forms thick bubbles, than (in another 15 seconds or so) turns dark. Add water and stir carefully.
